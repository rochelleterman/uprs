Presentation by the State under review 5. At the 16th meeting, on 13 May 2009, Slovakia presented its national report prepared in consultation with non-governmental organizations. 6. Slovakia noted that it is a party to almost all fundamental United Nations human rights treaties and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. No reservations were made to the commitments accepted under these instruments. 7. Slovakia stated that legal safeguards guaranteeing human rights were enshrined in the Constitution. International human rights treaties prevail over national laws. Amendments are being made to the Penal Code in preparation for the ratification of the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Measures are being taken to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol.. In response to the advanced questions concerning ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, Slovakia is analysing the Optional Protocol to identify the legislative amendments required. Slovakia strives for timely and regular submission of national reports under the United Nations treaty bodies and noted that all overdue reports will be submitted by the end of this year. Slovakia would appreciate streamlining and rationalizing of the reporting system. 8. Slovakia made reference its judicial and non-judicial human rights mechanisms. The latter being represented by the Ombudsman and the Slovak National Centre for Human Rights (SNCHR). At the executive level, human rights fall within the competence of the Deputy Prime Minister for the Knowledge-Based Society, European Affairs, Human Rights and Minorities. The Governmental Plenipotentiary for Roma Communities is responsible for an effective institutional framework to address problems of this minority. 9. The legal framework for the principle of equal treatment is the Antidiscrimination Act of 2004. The new Action Plan to combat racism, xenophobia, intolerance and discrimination, for 2009-2011, was adopted on the date of this review. Another step towards combating racism was the re-codification of the criminal law in 2005. 10. Approximately 14 per cent of population claims other than Slovak nationality and there are 12 officially recognized national minorities and ethnic groups. The language rights of members of minorities are defined in a number of regulations, and the 1999 Act on the Use of Minority Languages specifies the conditions for the use of minority languages in official communications. Persons belonging to national minorities have the right to education in their mother tongue. 11. Under the Act on Employment Services (2004), no special measures with respect to the position of minorities on the labour market are foreseen. However, special projects are implemented in order to avoid disproportionate effects of the economic crisis on any minority. 12. Slovakia stated that the excessive use of force by the police against Roma children in Ko.ice was incompatible with their duties; a prompt and impartial investigation has been initiated and concerned policemen were immediately dismissed from the police service and face prosecution. In order to address police harassment, measures for enhanced psychological care of policemen are taken, new educational programs are being prepared for special police schools and human rights training will be strengthened.  13. To address the challenges in the promotion and protection of women and children’s rights, the Government has been further improving the implementation of the respective United Nations Conventions. A permanent Ministerial Committee for Children was established and children’s rights are also monitored by SNCHR. 14. Domestic violence against women and children was of significant concern in Slovakia. Amendment to the Police Act (2008) permits the banning of perpetrators of domestic violence from the home for up to 48 hours. In cases where children are affected, a copy of the police record is sent to the social protection authority. Legislative and other measures, including the ratification of the European Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes and the gathering of data, have been taken to support victims of violent crimes. 15. In order to eliminate existing gender stereotypes in education and employment, Slovakia adopted an updated National Strategy for Gender Equality for 2009-2013 and is finalizing the National Action Plan for the Prevention and Elimination of Violence against Women for 2009.2012. Women and men have the right to equality in employment, remuneration, career growth and professional training. The Government increasingly promotes work-life balance measures. 16. Addressing concerns about the access of women and adolescent girls to affordable health-care services, including reproductive health care, a national programme of health care for women is under discussion and laws have been passed on access to voluntary family planning. 17. Slovakia underlined that forced sterilization of Roma women have never been an official state policy nor officially endorsed practice. Rights of human rights defenders, involved in this issue, in particular freedom of expression, have been guaranteed by law and no human rights defender has been prosecuted. 18. The Plenipotentiary of the Government for Roma Communities and her Office focuses on addressing issues of this community and improving its position via specific programmes to assist their integration into society. The department deals with the collection and processing of ethnic data and seeks to support self-awareness in the Roma population. The aim of the horizontal priority is to increase employment and the educational level of members of the affected minority and improve their conditions regarding education, employment, health, housing, elimination of poverty and support of equal opportunities. For this purpose, 178,000,000 euros have been allocated from the European Union funds. 19. With regard to education, the greatest problems faced by the Roma community are the high number of pupils in classes, irregular school attendance and an insufficient number of nursery schools. The Roma children are coming from socially disadvantaged and a low motivational environment.  20. Roma settlements, equipped with shops, community centres and schools, are far from villages and therefore desegregation requires time and specific actions. The quality of houses in Roma settlements is usually below standards and access to communal infrastructure is limited. The need for housing is further underscored by the increasing Roma population in the settlements and in the cities. Since 2001, the Slovak Government has allocated 1.2 billion koruny for construction of flats for marginalized groups. 21. A health programme to support disadvantaged communities for the period 2009-2015 was launched. The programme is being implemented by community health education workers. 22. The office participated in the preparation of the School Act amendment that enables the inclusion of teacher’s assistants and free education for children in the final year of nursery school. Moreover, through a grant programme, the department annually provides financial contributions for talented pupils of secondary grammar schools and university students. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 23. During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 48 delegations. A number of delegations thanked the Government for the comprehensive national report, its presentation and for the responses provided to advance questions. Statements were made welcoming Slovakia’s commitment to the universal periodic review process, its constructive participation and the consultations with stake holders that took place in preparing the national report. A number of states welcomed the ratification by Slovakia of most international human rights instruments and the institutional and legal framework for the promotion and protection of human rights. Several delegations noted also as a positive step the elaboration of policies and programmes targeted to Roma communities. 24. Recommendations made to Slovakia during the interactive dialogue are to be found in chapter II on Conclusions and Recommendations. 25. Finland welcomed the legislative efforts to improve the realization of the rights of the Roma minority, but was concerned that despite legislative improvements, many Roma children are still placed in special schools and classes for children with mental disabilities and learning difficulties. Finland inquired whether Slovakia is considering measures to ensure that Roma children have the same possibilities as the main population to enjoy the right to education. Finland appreciated the recognition of housing as one of the most difficult issues for the Roma and enquired as to Slovakia’s plans to improve the housing conditions of its Roma population and whether it sees possibilities for involving the Roma in this work.  26. Algeria noted that, as stated in paragraph 21 of the national report, Slovakia is a party to major international human rights instruments, and a party to several other humanitarian international instruments. Algeria also referred to inequalities between men and women in the area of remuneration, representation of women in decision-making and political organs and to the exercise of religious freedom.  27. Uzbekistan noted the creation of the National Council on Gender Equality, a commission to coordinate activity to eradicate race related crimes and a national plan of action to combat trafficking. Uzbekistan noted however, as noted by the treaty bodies and the special procedures, the increasing number of racially motivated crimes against members of minorities, including the Roma and other vulnerable groups. There is also a high level of violence in schools and families, and a lack of legislation which explicitly provide for prosecution for sexual exploitation of children. 28. The Russian Federation noted with satisfaction the importance given to the protection and promotion of the rights of national minorities and that Slovakia is a multi-ethnic country with some 12 officially recognized minorities and ethnic groups. Noting the serious problem of the sexual exploitation of children, it inquired whether Slovak legislation provides for prosecution for this offence. 29. India welcomed the amendment to article 127 of the Constitution introducing a constitutional complaint procedure and the adoption of a new Labour Code in 2007 reflecting the principle of equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value. India also noted the establishment of a separate government office for the Roma community and official standardization of Roma language. In spite of that, a wide concern has been expressed, inter alia, by the United Nations Development Programme, the Committee on the Rights of Children, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, about the persisting social exclusion. Therefore, India requested Slovakia to share information about the challenges face by the Government in better integration of the Roma community and urged the Government to take further necessary measures for sustainable social development of the Roma community. 30. Brazil commended Slovakia particularly for raising awareness on human rights issues and combating discrimination and the trafficking of human beings through a comprehensive national programme. Brazil also commended Slovakia for the quality of its health-care system, especially for the very low prevalence of HIV/AIDS, and for the excellence of the education system, compulsory for 10 years and free of charge.  31. Austria noted that several treaty bodies, including those mentioned in paragraph 29 above, the Human Rights Committee and the ILO Committee of Experts, have expressed concern about continued discrimination faced by members of the Roma minority in almost all walks of life and asked how the Government is following up on the many recommendations issued by the treaty bodies to effectively combat the discrimination and social exclusion experienced by a significant part of its population.  32. Serbia welcomed the transformation and extension of powers of the special board for persons with disabilities into the Council of the Government. Serbia asked if more information could be provided concerning the process of ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as well as cooperation with civil society in this regard. Serbia noted with interest the part of the national report containing information on the Action Plan for the Prevention of all Forms of Discrimination, Racism, Xenophobia, Anti-Semitism and Intolerance 2006-2008. Serbia wished to know if Slovakia intends to prepare a new Action Plan, and if so, what would be its contents. 33. Singapore noted that the Penal Code includes detailed classification of racially motivated crimes and declares unlawful any organisation and any activity promoting race-based discrimination. Slovakia has made it a key priority to help those among the Roma population who would stand to benefit from its multi-faceted strategy, encompassing education, employment, health, housing and tackling poverty and discrimination. Singapore proposed that if Slovakia could work with other countries or the European Community to do an event at the United Nations to better acquaint everyone with the culture and lives of the Roma communities, that could be useful to raise awareness and dispel misconceptions as well as serving as a gesture of recognition to these communities. 34. The Islamic Republic of Iran shared most of the concerns expressed by various human rights bodies, special procedures and civil society on the overall situation of human rights in Slovakia, particularly the extremely serious situation of Roma community. Social exclusion, as well as discrimination against Roma is widespread, notably in the field of employment, education, health care and housing. Moreover, media often portray Roma matters in a negative way, which exacerbates prejudice against this population. The Islamic Republic of Iran shared the concerns of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination at the occurrence of racially motivated crimes and encouraged Slovakia to combat the negative consequences of such trends. Iran also referred to the concerns of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Human Rights Committee at the continuing incidents of excessive use of force by police, and harassment.     35. Morocco praised Slovakia for the institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights, such as the Institute of the Mediator or ”Public Defender of Rights” and SNCHR, and asked if the Centre is a national institution based on the Paris Principles. Morocco referred to the importance paid by Slovakia to the question of education, in particular the human rights education.  36. Mexico congratulated Slovakia for the fact that in its Constitution, rights and fundamental freedoms are universally guaranteed without any distinction. It noted that there are still challenges in ensuring that the entire population enjoys these rights. Mexico recognized the significant progress seen in the promulgation of laws prohibiting forced sterilization but noted the observation of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on the existence of some cases, particularly against Roma women.   37. Canada noted a number of events organized by extremist groups aimed at promoting xenophobia and violence against minorities. Canada appreciated the existence of active and independent media expressing a variety of views without restrictions, but noted the coming into effect of a law that requires publishers to print responses to any statement of fact that impinges on the honour and reputation of a person or legal entity. 38. United Kingdom welcomed, inter alia, the anti-discrimination law, the law on judicial fees and the Civil Proceedings Act. It also looked forward to upcoming 2009-2013 Action Plan on Preventing and Eliminating Violence against Women and welcomed the National Action Plan for Children adopted in January. The United Kingdom noted that large sectors of the Roma communities live in conditions worse than those of other Slovak citizens; access to housing, health care and education remains a serious challenge. It further expressed concern at the number of incidents of police violence against the Roma and at the discriminatory language used by some politicians in referring to the Hungarian minority.  39. Pakistan noted that Slovakia accepts the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights; and the existence of different institutions and mechanisms for the protection of human rights, such as SNCHR and parliamentary committee for human rights. Pakistan also noted that the report provides space to the concerns of civil society on its policies. While noting the anti.discrimination act and institutional mechanisms to ensure these rights, Pakistan enquired as to the reasons for the persistence of related problems and the specific steps being taken to address this issue. 40. Switzerland welcomed the efforts of Slovakia for better respecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Nonetheless, national authorities and the civil society revealed a number of deficiencies in the implementation of the relevant provisions, thus keeping the Roma minority in a precarious condition. 41. Sweden welcomed the establishment of the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015. Sweden referred to Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and its concern about the high rate of violence against women and girls, including homicides resulting from domestic violence. It noted the national strategies and Government-sponsored campaign in order to raise awareness and it welcomed the information that those efforts will be strengthened in the National Action Plan that Slovakia is preparing for 2009-2012. Sweden welcomed the inclusion of sexual orientation within the anti-discrimination act and asked if today same-sex partners have been provided equal rights and responsibilities as opposite-sex partners in all areas of legislation. 42. Germany noted that only one non-governmental organization from Slovakia had provided input into the summary of stakeholders reports prepared by OHCHR and asked Slovakia for their views on the reasons for such an apparently low level of participation of non-governmental organizations in the universal periodic review process. With regard to the situation of women in the country, Germany asked further details on the programmes with regard to addressing the situation of wage gaps and the legal framework.  43. Ukraine requested more information on the implementation of the work-life balance measures approved in 2006 and its impact on ensuring gender equality and preventing domestic violence. Ukraine commended efforts to prevent and combat trafficking in human beings; the improvement of the identification of trafficking victims and training of law enforcement and judicial authorities to assist and protect victims. It enquired whether any training in human rights was provided for police officers and prison personnel to prevent torture and ill-treatment. 44. Turkey noted that the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern at the high rate of domestic violence in Slovakia and that the lack of legal tools to ensure that the perpetrators leave the family environment. Turkey asked whether Slovakia has undertaken any legislative measure to penalize sexual exploitation and abuse of children in its criminal law. Turkey recognized efforts to improve the situation of the Roma community. Nonetheless, a number of treaty bodies remain concerned about Roma’s situation. Turkey asked what measures were taken to change the negative perception of the Roma community in the society as suggested by several treaty bodies.  45. Cuba indicated that the elimination of all forms of racism, xenophobia and racial discrimination is a collective commitment of the international community, and Slovakia still has a lot of progress to be made in this area. Cuba asked what measures does Slovakia intend to implement to ensure full respect of human rights of minority groups, in particular Roma, who are victims of various discriminatory practices, as amply noted by various special procedures and treaty bodies. 46. Portugal commended Slovakia for its “Action Plan for Prevention of all Forms of Discrimination, Racism and Xenophobia, Anti-Semitism and Intolerance” and inquired whether specific measures have been taken to combat, in particular, the negative perception of Roma persons and individuals belonging to minorities. Portugal asked what measures were envisaged to address comprehensively the problem of social exclusion based on difficult access to employment, housing, education and healthcare. Portugal expressed concern about the high level of violence against women and girls, including victims of trafficking.  47. The Netherlands noted that Slovakia has paid special attention to issues concerning the Roma minority. However, responsibilities for Roma issues are now dispersed over several different authorities despite persistent problems with housing, education, health and access to the labour market.  48. Argentina welcomed Slovakia’s inclusion of extensive protection of human rights in the Constitution and the reform of the Constitution establishing the supremacy of the international instruments. Argentina noted the creation of the commission for coordinated action in the elimination of racially motivated crimes. Argentina further asked how the Council for the Equality between Genders functions and if new legislation has been adopted or legislation amended to protect women against discrimination.  49. Slovenia commended Slovakia for the elaboration of the Decade and National Action Plan for Roma Inclusion 2005-2015. Slovenia, while commending Slovakia on the Action Plan for Children and for establishing a permanent Ministerial Committee for Children, was concerned about the disproportionate number of Roma children placed in special schools and classes. It inquired as to when Roma children are likely to receive education in the Roma language, taking into account its official standardization in June 2008 to serve as a basis for such education. 50. Jordan commended the efforts of Slovakia to develop and strengthen its legislative and institutional framework, including through the establishment of the SNCHR. It noted that this has been complemented by the accession to many international human rights conventions, which take primacy over national legislation, which reflects Slovakia’s firm commitment to human rights. 51. Bosnia and Herzegovina encouraged Slovakia to submit outstanding reports to United Nations treaty bodies, especially initial reports on implementation of two additional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It asked Slovakia to elaborate more about efforts on steps taken. It also asked Slovakia to elaborate on measures undertaken to combat trafficking in women and children including sexual exploitation. It encouraged Slovakia to continue to implement programs and projects in the field of health for Roma, as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It asked Slovakia for more information on measures to be taken to ensure that children, particularly Roma children, have equal opportunities for access to schools. 52. The Holy See asked the delegation of Slovakia to elaborate on the adoption, in 2008, by the Government, of a National Programme to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings to face the increasing presence of irregular migrants from neighbouring countries. The Holy See also noted that treaty bodies are concerned about discrimination against the Roma, especially Roma children and asked what initiatives the Government was undertaking in order to improve the situation of vulnerable groups of children, in particular Roma children.  The Holy See commended Slovakia for the Family Act Law which calls for the protection of marriage and noted that Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women was concerned at the persisting high rate of abortion. 53. Malaysia welcomed the enactment of the Anti-Discrimination Act 2004 which contains provisions that serve to correct existing forms of social and economic disadvantages among the population. Malaysia also noted that Slovakia has made positive gains in protecting and promoting women’s human rights highlighting that the establishment of the Government Council for Gender Equality 2008 and the proposed National Action Plan 2009-2013 to combat domestic violence reflects the government’s commitment in that regard.  54. Kazakhstan noted with interest, inter alia, the Council of the Government for National Minorities and Ethnic Groups. Kazakhstan commended that it is of utmost importance that minority cultures are supported through a grant system. Kazakhstan noted that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that it combat the negative consequences of racially motivated crimes. It requested information on the work done to realise the recommendations of these committees. Noting the concern of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women that women are underrepresented in political and public decision-making bodies, Kazakhstan requested statistical data or surveys on this issue. 55. In responding to questions, Slovakia informed, that a medium-term concept of development of Roma was adopted. It covers the areas of education, housing, social areas, employment and health care. The issue of human trafficking is also being addressed in this framework.  56. Slovakia mentioned that in the field of education efforts are being made not to put Roma children into special schools. Children living in poverty have free food at schools and pre.schools. Parents with low income receive subsidies to cover school expenses.   57. In the field of housing Slovakia informed of a long-term programme for marginalized groups. The Government in cooperation with civil society discuss the definition and understanding of social housing. Measures to legalize the Roma settlements are also needed.  58. Slovakia noted that the Roma language is part of the Roma identity. Its standardization in 2008 promotes the use and publishing of textbooks in Roma language.  59. Angola commended the implementation of political and economic reforms. However, concerns exist regarding the situation of ethnic minorities and documented reports of violence by far-right groups against immigrants. According to the ILO Committee of Experts many Roma still face difficulties and discrimination in, inter alia, employment and education. In this connection, Angola noted that the Framework Agreement on Roma Communities was a positive step forward and asked whether any other measure to eliminate discrimination against the Roma community have been taken. Noting that the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concerns over the limited scope of the existing legislation to eliminate gender-based discrimination, Angola asked what strategies the Government was implementing to overcome remaining challenges concerning gender based discrimination.   60. The Republic of Moldova commended Slovakia for its active cooperation with national and international stakeholders, inclusively with the United Nations and European mechanisms for human rights. With regard to the rights of children and the recommendations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Republic of Moldova asked about the mechanism of cooperation with UNICEF and the United Nations Agency Panel on Juvenile Justice for ensuring at the national level the adequate standards on juvenile justice. 61. France welcomed the establishment of the post of Mediator and the Plan of Action for the improvement and progressive integration of the Roma community. France asked what measures had been taken to meet concerns of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women regarding the high rate of violence against women and girls. Noting that Slovakia had allocated 185 million euros for 2008-2013 to assist the Roma community, it asked what measures had been taken to implement the right to health for the Roma population and, particularly, to improve their information on preventative medicine. France enquired what measures had been adopted to create an independent monitoring mechanism for implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 62. Nigeria noted that Slovakia made no reservation with regard to commitments to all the human rights conventions and treaties it has ratified and applauded Slovakia for establishing the SNCHR in 1993 and for the abolition of death penalty in 1990. Noting that the national report highlighted that trafficking in human beings is a serious problem, Nigeria wished to have additional elaboration on the concrete steps Slovakia intends to take regarding trafficking for sexual purposes often involving minors.  63. Hungary welcomed the establishment of the Office of the Public Defender of Rights and the new procedure for constitutional complaints that deals with alleged violations of constitutional rights including human rights. Hungary noted that the United Nations treaty bodies have repeatedly urged Slovakia to recognize the rights of persons belonging to minority groups and to consider adopting a comprehensive legal act providing protection of the rights of such persons. The Council of Europe Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities noted existing plans to draft legislation on national minorities but pointed out that they were not well know among representatives of national minorities and non-governmental organizations.  64. Japan appreciated Slovakia’s efforts to protect the rights of minorities with the establishment of a five-year plan focused on its Roma communities. It noted that there are many examples of Roma children being placed into special schools for disabled children, without clearly defined selection criteria or effective independent complaint mechanisms for parents.  65. Croatia acknowledged, inter alia, the Solidarity-Integrity-Inclusion programme from 2008-2013 as well as the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015. Croatia noted, however, that despite efforts, there have been reports of widespread discrimination, prejudice and questionable police behaviour against Roma population. Croatia called upon Slovakia to undertake additional efforts in strengthening awareness-raising and other preventive activities for the benefit of Roma population, including education system that can serve as a tool to build bridges and common understanding between Roma and the rest of the community.  66. Azerbaijan noted the anti-discrimination act and “Action Plan for the Prevention of all forms of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and intolerance”. Azerbaijan shared serious concern of some treaty bodies on cases of discrimination against Roma in various spheres, and wished to receive information on the measures Slovakia has undertaken or plans to undertake to address this problem. There are still problems to be addressed, such as domestic violence, particularly abuse of children, corporal punishment as well as high level of rape of children. Azerbaijan was concerned about reporting cases of sterilization of Roma women without prior and informed consent. 67. Belgium drew Slovakia’s attention to the concerns expressed by different treaty bodies concerning the excessive use of violence by police forces in Slovakia. Behaviour seems often to be inspired by racial motivations. Belgium also made reference to recommendations form the Human Rights Committee to open investigations, in order to prosecute those guilty of those acts and provide remedies to victims and also offer them compensation, as well as recommendations by Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to create an independent monitoring mechanism to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed by the police force. It further noted that Slovakia has so far not informed the Human Rights Committee on measures taken to implement such recommendations.  68. The Czech Republic congratulated Slovakia for the establishment of the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Government for Roma Communities as well as the Anti-Discrimination Act of 2004 and asked whether these measures were implemented and built upon. It also welcomed the establishment of the public defender of rights (the ombudsman) and wished to know more about its functioning and the way in which its independence and funding were secured. 69. Spain asked if Slovakia intended to ratify the Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It also asked about measures being taken given this low level of granting asylum, as well as if Slovakia has a specialized detention centre for dangerous detainees who suffer psychiatric conditions and about measures to allow small children to remain with their imprisoned mothers if they requested so.  70. The Republic of Korea noted Slovakia’s extension of a standing invitation to the United Nations special procedures. It referred to concerns raised by United Nations treaty bodies about the Roma population, especially women and children facing racially motivated discrimination and violence. It also wished to know Slovakia’s views on the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child that corporal punishment be prohibited by law in all settings, including at home. 71. South Africa remained concerned at the overall situation of the Roma minority and Roma children, a concern raised by the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Rights of the Child. South Africa asked for clarification concerning measures that the Government took to review legislation that does not reflect the principle of substantive equality fully embodied in CEDAW. South Africa also sought clarity on best practices on human rights that have been incorporated in the training programmes of police and prisons officers. 72. New Zealand commended Slovakia for adopting a National Plan for Children, as promised in its Human Rights Council campaign pledge and asked what steps had been taken to ensure the rights and special needs of children are being met in the justice system, in particular to ensure that juvenile justice standards are fully respected. New Zealand thanked Slovakia’s comments that the placement of Roma children in special schools is not as ad hoc in the new legislation, and that there is improved cooperation with the Ministry of Education.  73. Montenegro noted that Slovakia has sufficient institutional framework in place to protect human rights for all its citizens. Montenegro appreciated that Slovakia was among the first countries to extend a standing invitation to the United Nations special procedures. Montenegro requested Slovakia to dwell on the challenges and limitations, current and planned efforts to overcome the existing obstacles achieving satisfactory results. 74. Bangladesh stated that human rights mechanisms and treaty bodies noted the persistent discrimination against the Roma population remains a critical challenge. A series of measures have been taken to improve the situation of Roma population however, the Roma community living conditions, limited or selective access to education and healthcare continued to block their socio-economic emancipation. Government’s efforts to improve this situation are undermined by reported excessive police brutality against the Roma minority and the forced exploitation, trafficking and sterilization of Roma women.  75. The United States of America made reference to reports of police mistreatment of Romani suspects, including recent reports of abuses of six Romani minors in Kosice while in police custody and asked Slovakia how it plans to address the problem. The United States asked Slovakia how it has addressed the concerns of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) about the media law, which has now been in effect for one year, and about the status of freedom of expression for members of the press.  76. Bulgaria welcomed especially approval of the “Medium Term Concept of the Roma Ethnic Minority in Slovakia Solidarity-Integrity-Inclusion 2008-2013”. Bulgaria commended recent amendments to legislation on the status of foreign nationals and on asylum aiming to bring them in full compliance with EU-related legislation. It appreciated the adoption of the asylum policy paper mainstreaming the efforts of individual stakeholders engaged in addressing migration policy issues. 77. Slovakia stated that SNCHR enjoyed a “B” status category level.   78. The anti-discrimination act stipulates a list of grounds on which the discrimination is prohibited, including sexual orientation. 79. The Action Plan for the Prevention of all Forms of Discrimination, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance for 2009-2011, is already the fifth action plan aiming at establishing effective mechanism for the reduction of hate crimes, intolerance, integration of minorities, public awareness, training of professional groups and multicultural education. 80. The 2008-2010 National Programme to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings is based on international human rights standards and promotes protection of victims. It respects the principle of gender equality. The program is carried out with the direct participation of the civil society.  81. Concerning the prevention of racially-motivated crimes, the police participate in the implementation of the respective action plan. New programmes have been prepared for police schools, including psychological training. 82. On legislative measures on sexual exploitation and abuse of children, Slovakia transposed the European Union Council Framework Decision on the fight against sexual exploitation of children and child pornography into its legislation in January 2006. Trafficking in children, sexual abuse, production, spreading and possession of child pornography are severely prosecuted. Slovakia continues to take new legislative measures on these crimes. The new draft amendment to the Criminal Code will reflect the most recent forms of sexual and other forms of abuse on children. The amendment will also precise the definition of child pornography.   83. Regarding the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the provisions of the Convention were implemented by the draft amendment to the Criminal Code. The Convention will be submitted to Parliament for approval and then to the President for ratification. 84. The so-called Press Act does not limit freedom of expression, and is based on freedom of speech and freedom of information, which are guaranteed by the Constitution.
