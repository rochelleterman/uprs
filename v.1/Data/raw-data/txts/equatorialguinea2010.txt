Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The delegation trusted that the universal periodic review will allow Equatorial Guinea to continue working for the defense and protection of Human Rights. It noted that the national report is the result of a consultative process at the national level and was elaborated by a commission. In a spirit of transparency, the national report analysed, as objectively as possible, the human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea, its different international commitments and the difficulties encountered in their implementation. 6. The delegation mentioned that Equatorial Guinea obtained national independence on 12October 1968 and that in this short political trajectory and relatively short period of time, the country has made firm steps forward in the field of human rights, despite the fact that the regime set up in the country immediately after its national independence and which lasted more than eleven years,  had worsened the already dire human rights situation inherited from the colonial regime and which was characterized by systematic human rights violations. 7. The delegation stressed that human rights issues were taken up thanks to the action taken starting from the Freedom Coup of 3 August 1979 which allowed the government to install the rule of law in a democratic state, in order to eradicate the injustices and violations of the previous regime. 8. The delegation stated that, its country is a party to a number of international human rights instruments, which constitutes the framework for cooperation with the Human Right Council.   9. Through its Constitution, the fundamental law of Equatorial Guinea of 1982, the country has progressively achieved a democratic and social State. The (constitutional) amendment of 1991 (Inclusion of Political pluralism), and of 1995 (creation of Constitutional Court) constituted important goals in the political and legal history of Equatorial Guinea. 10. The delegation made an introduction of the different sections of the national report. B.

It noted the promulgation of Law N.6/2006 on the Prevention and sanction of Torture and stressed that for the implementation of this Law, the Government has undertaken awareness raising actions for the public order forces, state security forces, judges and for all involved sectors. It added that the application of this Law is bearing its fruits because there have been a number of condemnations. 53. The delegation indicated that since the Freedom Coup, the Government has been inviting the United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights to visit the country, and has, at all times, offered its cooperation in order to facilitate their missions, which showed the political will of the Government to improve the human rights situation in the country.  54. Regarding efforts to solve the phenomenon of child labour, the delegation referred to the promulgation of Law N. 2/2004 from January 4th on the General Labour Laws, which regulates Child Labour and prevents people younger than 14 years from working. Was also promulgated the Law N. 1/2004 from September 14th on the illegal traffic of migrants and trafficking in persons, which sanction Child Labour and parental abuse of the child.  In application of this disposition, the Interior Ministry had issued a ministerial Order prohibiting street selling by children and instructing relevant authorities to strictly implement the laws, particularly the Law on illegal trafficking of Migrants. The Government has also carried out seminars through the Ministry of Justice and Worship for all people involved in the issue so that they are aware of the legislation in force. 55. According to the delegation, the Government, in its ambitious development plan “Guinea Equatorial Horizon 2020”, has established priorities in the area of Human Rights which fully foresee cooperation,  including through training of human resources, empowering of public agents and public services, awareness raising at all levels on Human Rights, particularly on the rights of Women, Children and other vulnerable groups, participation of civil society in training programs about Human rights, introduction of the concept of Human Rights values and ethic in the programs of primary, secondary and higher education. The delegation reiterated the willingness to continue developing the human rights process, counting on international cooperation. 56. The delegation highlighted among measures adopted by the Government the following: • In education, it reformed in 2006 the Law of 1995 on General education, a reform which aimed at ending the state monopoly in education and to develop education at all levels; • In 2003, the educational plan was passed for the promotion and schooling of the girl child, sexual education, material education of the population and family life, thus offering equal opportunity for boys and girls to access education; • 	Through the Ministry of Social Affairs and Promotion of Women, a program to promote literacy among women, girls and female adolescents, on the national level, has been implemented, with the active support of the Cuban cooperation; • On access to land property, there is the Project for the Promotion of Self-Employment for Rural Women (PRAMUR), which started its first phase in 2001 with the technical and financial support of the Canadian Cooperation. The second phase, which started in 2007, has been funded though the Social Fund under the technical management of the United States Agency for International Development. The funding of this project in 2008 was in the amount of $4,500,000; • Women participated without any restriction to the decision-making process, both at family level and public life. Nevertheless, in family life, the culture which promotes birth and the patriarchal pattern of relations within the family continued to be some of the reasons why women have very little decision-making power for example in family planning, education of children etc.  However, programs are carried out on education, information and communication in order to change these behavioural patterns. 57. Regarding the measures sanctioning domestic violence and implemented policies in this regard, the delegation noted that the Fundamental Law the country, which establishes the rights and liberties of citizens, proclaims in its Article 13, respect for the person, its life, its personal integrity, its dignity and its full material and moral realisation, and indicated, in this regard, that women regardless of their marital status have the same rights and responsibilities as men in all orders of public, private and family life, and as well as in civil, political, economical, social and cultural areas. 58. The delegation mentioned that a criminal code exists and sanctions physical aggression and lesions of people. This code is being reformed, and gender based violence will be considered as an aggravating factor. Also, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Promotion of Women is elaborating a bill which would foresee full protection against gender based violence. Awareness-raising and training are being brought to all levels of society, to authorities and the population in general to respect the rights of women, and to eliminate violence against women. In addition, the delegation stated that in 2009, a reform of the Organic Law of the Judicial Power have been initiated, which articulates more independence and transparency of the jurisdictional bodies in their duties. In this sense, the application of the promulgated laws on torture and respect of human rights will be guaranteed. 59. The delegation indicated that the Government is carrying out intense activities to develop the country, and in order to better distribute wealth, it is improving social infrastructure and is working on the areas of productivity. In addition to efforts by the Government in all sectors, it attached special priority to human development. In this respect, the Fund for Social Development was created in 2005 with the objective to strengthen the implementation of policies to provide basic needs to people, and to achieve human development. 60. The delegation noted that for the elaboration of the national report, there was collaboration with the civil society, for instance the Family Welfare Association of Equatorial Guinea (ABIFAGE), the Committee for the Support of the Child in Equatorial Guinea (CANIGE) and the National Commission on Human Rights. 61. Also, the delegation stressed that the Government has a wide program to eliminate some interrogation procedures that agents are using with detainees. Such program includes the promulgation of legal dispositions such as the Law on prevention of Torture and the Law on Habeas Corpus; the Organic Law on Judicial power and the draft Criminal Code. Trainings and seminars are also carried out to Police and National Security Forces. 62. With regard to the independence of Judicial Power, it is guaranteed in Article 83 of the Constitution and Article 84 of this Constitution states that justice emanates from the people and is administrated on behalf of the Head of State. These two mentioned precepts justify the content of Article 86 which the United Kingdom that asked to be abrogated. This Article expressed that the Head of State is the first Magistrate of the Nation and guarantees jurisdictional independency, as far as justice is administrated on its behalf. 63. Regarding the issue of standing invitation to human rights special procedures, the delegation referred to item 9 of its National report related to the cooperation with the human rights system of the United Nations. 64. The delegation noted that there is a legal framework which regulates the right of free association, assembly as well as the right of people of not being deprived of liberty without a judicial Order. In this sense, the Law N. 5/1995 has been promulgated. This Law regulates the Habeas Corpus procedure that orders the immediate disposal of any person illegally detained before a judicial authority , to hear such person and decide on the legality of arrest and to maintain  the arrest or not. 65. The delegation informed that Equatorial Guinea was already party to the Convention against Torture which was ratified on May 22nd 2002. The process of the Protocol ratification is continuing. In addition, the Government is implementing reforms of all the penitentiary institutions in the country. In this framework, the penitentiary facilities of Malabo, Bata, Mongomo and Evinayong have been improved. The Law N. 5/1989, promulgated on October 20th created the Special Corps of Prisons, which main mission is the management and administration of the penitentiary facilities. Specific training on human rights directed at agents of public order and to those in charge of penitentiary institutions is carried out with the cooperation of France and the United States of America. 66. The delegation informed that according to the Constitution, the death penalty can only be imposed for crimes included in the Law. In that sense, it is important to note that a moratorium on the application of death penalty exists, even if this sentence does not apply frequently in the country, and many of those condemned to capital punishment have been reprieved or had their sentences commuted. 67. The delegation noted that the Government continued to carry out various programs and actions that directly or indirectly promote, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental liberties of its citizens. 68. For the delegation, the Government did not consider that the presentation of the national report on the implementation of human rights and public liberties is undermining its sovereignty, since it committed to treaties and International Conventions. Equatorial Guinea has the political will to realize development and the effective enjoyment of civil, political, social, and cultural rights. The information provided is based on a meticulous examination which has allowed all interlocutors to have an updated and reflective opinion on the national reality. 69. Despite the progress, the Government is aware that a lot still needs to be done, and expressed its strong political will to continue implementing the process of improving human rights, counting always with the cooperation of the international community. II.
