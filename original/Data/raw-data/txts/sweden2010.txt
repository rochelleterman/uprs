A list of questions prepared in advance by Algeria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Switzerland was transmitted to Sweden through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The Swedish delegation stated that the promotion and respect of human rights was a priority for Sweden and a cornerstone of country’s foreign policy. 6. The preparation of the national report had been transparent and inclusive. Sweden was a parliamentary democracy founded on the rule of law. Sweden was a party to many human rights treaties and had accepted the most far-reaching scrutiny of its human rights record. The Swedish general welfare system was extensive and had contributed to the practical enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 7. Sweden had five national minorities: the Jews, the Roma, the Sami, the Swedish Finns and the Tornedalers. In 1977, the Sami had been recognized by Parliament as Sweden’s only indigenous people. Migration had contributed to the shaping of a multicultural society.  8. Sweden was committed to respecting human rights, while acknowledging the challenges facing it. 9. The Penal Code provided for aggravated sentencing for crimes motivated by hatred. Measures taken include training for police and prosecutors, new manuals, the establishment of a special hate crimes unit and a hate crimes telephone hotline. The police monitored organizations engaged in racist activities. Another tool for fighting prejudice was the provision of State funding to non-governmental organizations.   10. Freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of religion were enshrined in the Constitution. Censorship of written media had been prohibited since 1949. According to the Freedom of the Press Act, interventions against the contents of publications were allowed regarding cases of incitement to racial hatred.  11. The fight against discrimination was a priority. The most recent initiative was the new Discrimination Act, which reinforced monitoring and included two new grounds of discrimination, age and transgender identity or expression. The Act had introduced protection in areas not previously covered, such as discrimination in the public sector.  12. Sweden remained committed to the fight against torture and was a party to the most far-reaching supervisory mechanisms. Sweden had received visits from both the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. The crime of torture had been penalized under several provisions in the Penal Code, including aggravated assault. 13. The judicial system was based on the principle of free examination of evidence. Procedural safeguards effectively excluded any evidence obtained under torture.  14. The Aliens Act stipulated that refusal of entry to or the expulsion of an alien may never be enforced when there are reasonable grounds for assuming that the alien would be in danger of suffering the death penalty or being subjected to torture or ill treatment.  15. Sweden has a generous migration policy. The recent increase in the number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children had put reception facilities under considerable strain; however, the Government was consulting with municipalities to address that issue.  16. All asylum-seeking children had the same rights to education and child care, and were entitled to health care on the same footing with other children. A Government inquiry was investigating how the right to subsidized health care could be expanded.  17. The aim of Swedish gender equality policy was to change systems and conditions so that women and men could enjoy the same power and opportunites and were able to influence their own lives. Measures undertaken included an action plan on prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes and a strategy on gender equality in the labour market.  18. Violence against women, including sexual violence, was still a problem. In 2007, a national action plan was adopted to combat violence perpetrated by men against women, violence and oppression in the name of honour, and violence in same-sex relationships. A law prohibiting the purchase of sexual services was an important tool in preventing trafficking and sexual exploitation. 19. The Sami Parliament had been established in 1993. The Government continued to study the ratification of ILO Convention No. 169, but all possible legal consequences would have to be further clarified. 20. Sweden had adopted two national human rights action plans: one covering the period 2002-2004, and one for 2006-2009. The Government had appointed a Delegation on Human Rights to achieve full respect for human rights. The Delegation would submit its final report in September 2010. In that context, the establishment of an independent national human rights institution would be discussed. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 21. During the interactive dialogue, 53 delegations made statements. Additional statements that could not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to time constraints will be posted on the extranet of the universal periodic review when available.1 Recommendations made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report.  22. A number of delegations acknowledged the constructive engagement of the Swedish Government with the universal periodic review mechanism and commended the delegation for the detailed and informed presentation of the report. They also praised Sweden for its human rights record and its commitment to human rights. 23. Switzerland noted the efforts made by Sweden in the area of human rights education and training, and welcomed the new draft law in that regard. Switzerland also noted the issue of the lack of adequate housing and homeless children, pointing out that the lack of data had hampered the implementation of programmes to improve the situation of homeless children. Switzerland made a recommendation.  24. Nicaragua noted Sweden’s high rank in the UNDP Human Development Index. It noted that human rights were a priority for Sweden’s foreign policy and its development cooperation. Nicaragua regretted the conditioning of aid as against the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Efficiency. It encouraged Sweden to assume a belligerent position so that the European Union could be more flexible in commercial negotiations. Nicaragua made recommendations.   25. Belarus was concerned about the increases in racially motivated crimes, racist propaganda and sex tourism, as well as about the situation of unaccompanied migrant children and the lengthy holding of such children in custodial centres. Belarus made recommendations. 26. Greece asked Sweden to share its best practices in the protection of human rights and recognized Sweden’s achievements in promoting women’s rights, stressing that further action could be taken. Greece noted reports of anti-Semitic crimes and that Muslims had been denied employment. It also noted that the rights of the Sami to their traditional lands and natural resources were systematically violated. Greece made recommendations. 27. Algeria welcomed Sweden’s commitment to contribute up to 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to development assistance. It was concerned about the recent increase in incidents of racism and xenophobia against minorities, refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants, as well as about incidents of Islamophobia. Algeria made recommendations. 28. Brazil commended Sweden for the Anti-Discrimination Act and for establishing a single ombudsman. It noted the increase in hate crimes and asked if they had been prosecuted. It asked whether the new definition of hate crime was being applied by the judiciary. It noted that treaty bodies had expressed concern about the detention of migrants and asylum-seekers. Brazil made recommendations. 29. Canada commended Sweden for establishing a Children’s Ombudsman and ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

It noted that both countries shared similar concerns and good practices regarding the situation of indigenous peoples. Canada made recommendations.  1 Kazakhstan, Costa Rica, Kuwait, Burundi, Ecuador, Ghana and Mauritius.  30. Nigeria acknowledged Sweden’s commitment to human rights, emphasizing that it had extended a standing invitation to special procedures. Nigeria welcomed the establishment of the Swedish Aliens Act, which allowed for a new system of appeals and procedures in the field of migration and asylum. Nigeria made recommendations. 31. Djibouti welcomed the adoption of the National Plan on Human Rights and its periodic evaluation. It noted with interest Sweden’s high rank in the Human Development Index. Djibouti referred to the concern of several treaty bodies about the lack of a modality for the domestic implementation of international human rights instruments. Djibouti noted with appreciation that Sweden had made combating discrimination a priority. Djibouti made a recommendation. 32. The Russian Federation acknowledged Sweden’s high level of human rights protection. However, it noted the persistence of discrimination based on ethnicity and gender. It also noted concern regarding the law on screening electronic messages. It also referred to the number of responses to the thematic questionnaires of special procedures. The Russian Federation made recommendations. 33. Pakistan stressed that criminalizing the purchase of sexual services was an important step in combating human trafficking. It requested information about the evaluation of the first action plan on human rights. Pakistan questioned the Swedish approach of including the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons as part of its human rights priorities, as their rights were not universally recognized and this could amount to imposing one set of values on others. Pakistan made recommendations. 34. Qatar acknowledged that democracy and human rights formed the basis of Swedish society and appreciated the welfare system, by which the Government bore most of the costs of social services. Qatar inquired what measures had been taken to prevent discrimination against migrant and refugee women and women of minority backgrounds. Qatar made a recommendation. 35. Portugal noted Sweden’s efforts to combat violence against children and discrimination. It noted that the Special Rapporteur on violence against women had highlighted challenges regarding unequal power relations between women and men, as well as its low prosecution and conviction rates.

Portugal made recommendations. 36. India appreciated Sweden’s welfare system and welcomed progressive measures to enhance human rights education and training. India also noted the Anti-Discrimination Act, the second National Action Plan for Human Rights and the establishment of the Equality Ombudsman, but observed the continued existence of discrimination. India inquired about further steps to combat violence against women. India made a recommendation. 37. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted persistent discrimination against Roma and Sami; increasing numbers of racially motivated hate crimes; high levels of child abuse and neglect and other domestic violence; continued discrimination against immigrants, refugees and minority women; the non-criminalization of torture; the denial of access to facilities to Muslim women; and racist and xenophobic overtones in the public arena and discrimination against Muslims. Iran expressed grave concern at increasing trends of Islamophobia.

Romania also noted that there was no independent national human rights institution and asked for updated information in that regard. 41. Finland welcomed the new legislation on minorities and minority languages and asked about how access for minorities to social services could be improved, and how the Delegation for Roma Issues was carrying out its functions. Finland also asked about the benefits of having merged four distinct entities into the Equality Ombudsman. Finland made recommendations. 42. Egypt noted the adoption of Sweden’s second National Action Plan for Human Rights, with its main focus on discrimination, and the new Anti-Discrimination Act. However, Egypt echoed the concerns expressed by treaty bodies regarding the increase in racially motivated crimes and the low number of prosecutions. Egypt also inquired about measures taken to combat the trafficking in women and children. Egypt made recommendations. 43. Cuba expressed concerns about racial hatred crimes, the dissemination of racist propaganda, religious intolerance, the reluctance to prosecute cases of discrimination against minorities, and the excessive use of force against migrants.

Spain made recommendations. 45. New Zealand welcomed the new Act on national minorities and minority languages. However, it noted that the land issues of the Sami people had not been resolved and asked questions in that regard. It was concerned about the use of diplomatic assurances and about challenges faced by persons with disabilities. It regretted that Sweden had yet to establish an independent national human rights institution.

Sweden highlighted national action plans and ongoing inquiries regarding its human rights work. A delegation had been formed in 2006 to support the second national action plan and would submit its report in September 2010. The second action plan would also be evaluated. The two inquiries and the universal periodic review recommendations would be important input for Sweden’s reporting to Parliament in 2011. 54. Sweden noted its elaborate network of human rights institutions. The four previous ombudsmen had been accredited by the International Coordinating Committee, but their accreditation status lapsed in November 2008 as a result of their merging. A new application was being prepared by the Equality Ombudsman, the new institution for combating discrimination. When the delegation for human rights delivered its report, the establishment of a national human rights institution that would possibly complement the ombudsman would be considered. 55. Violence against women was a particular challenge and a high priority. The national plan of action provided for measures to support women subjected to violence, targeted violent men, provided attention for children and included special measures to address sexual violence. The plan was being evaluated by the national council for crime prevention. 56. A new strategy on national minorities had been adopted to improve the implementation of relevant conventions. It included measures to promote national minority languages and culture, as well as participation. An administrative board and the Sami Parliament were entrusted with following up on the minority policy. 57. Roma were particularly affected by prejudice. A Delegation for Roma issues had been established in 2007 and mandated to promote and support municipal projects and services to improve the situation of the Roma. The delegation would submit its final report in June 2010. 58. Sweden reiterated that organizations involved in racist activities were breaking the law and were being countered through legislation and the police. 59. A bill had been submitted to Parliament proposing an amendment to the Constitution to give explicit recognition to the Sami. Sami policy promoted self-determination on issues directly affecting them. The Sami Parliament had been given new responsibilities regarding reindeer herding, and in 2006 the Government had submitted a bill on increasing Sami independence. 60. Sweden condemned all incitement to violence or hatred, and provisions concerning hate crimes were stipulated under law. Sweden firmly condemned Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and was committed to combating all forms of racism and intolerance. Threats and harassment against religious congregations were addressed by law enforcement authorities. In Sweden, it was the Chancellor of Justice that handled cases concerning incitement to racial hatred.  61. Freedom of expression was a priority. Nonetheless, it had limitations in international law. Swedish law regulated those limitations, including through the prohibition of agitation against a national or ethnic group. Websites were protected from censorship and prohibitive measures. Notwithstanding, there were mechanisms for prosecuting violators of the right to freedom of expression, employed by the competent public agencies; the Government was constitutionally prohibited from intervening in particular cases. 62. Ensuring children’s rights was also a priority. Sweden was one of the largest contributors to UNICEF and had a clear policy on implementing children’s rights, based on CRC. Those efforts also covered asylum-seeking children and provisions regarding health care, education and the fight against poverty among children. 63. The migration and asylum policy was based on the full realization of human rights. The policy guaranteed long-term sustainability, safeguarded the right to asylum, facilitated cross-border mobility, promoted needs-based labour immigration, supported the positive impact of migration and expanded international cooperation. Measures were being taken to combat the disappearance of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. 64. Through its implementation of the provisions of the six core human rights instruments, Sweden had already fulfilled most of the principles set out in ICRMW. Migrant workers already enjoyed equal rights with citizens.  65. Sweden had ratified ICRPD and CRPD-OP in 2008. Sweden ensured that its legislation was in line with the Convention. With regard to CED, Sweden had signed it in 2007 and was considering ratification. 66. Sweden noted that it had strict regulations requiring that arms not be exported to countries in armed conflict in which there was a risk of violating humanitarian law. 67. Concerning the Signals Intelligence Act, Sweden noted that there was a legitimate interest in having an efficient tool for collecting intelligence from foreign counties, balanced with the protection of personal integrity and the right to privacy. A special intelligence court had been established to examine requests for carrying out signals intelligence, and a special inspectorate had been established to verify compliance with the Act. Furthermore, the Data Protection Board monitored the agency carrying out such activities. Sweden stressed that its primary interest was in creating a clear legal basis for such activities, which was in conformity with its human rights obligations.  68. Sweden noted that it was not its regular practice to use diplomatic assurances when expelling aliens who had been refused asylum or residence permits. Diplomatic assurances had been used in two cases in 2001, which had been heavily criticised by the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture, and such assurances had not been used since. 69. Sweden stressed that it had not been involved in anything referred to as rendition carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency. 70. Turkey applauded Sweden’s high human rights standards, but noted that efforts were needed to combat discrimination against the Roma, the Sami and migrant communities. Turkey expressed concern at discrimination against persons of non-Swedish background in the judicial and law-enforcement systems. It asked about the Anti-Discrimination Act and measures to combat hate speech. Turkey urged the strengthening of efforts to prevent violence against women and asked about compliance with the Convention against Torture and the establishment of a national human rights institution. 71. Argentina noted the implementation of the second National Plan for Human Rights and a constitutional clause providing that public institutions must combat discrimination. It also noted that the Aliens Act permitted the granting of refugee status to women fleeing gender-based violence and to people fleeing persecution based on sexual orientation. Argentina made recommendations.  72. Botswana commended Sweden for its achievements in gender equality as well as children’s rights. Botswana requested information about the implementation of the 2007 national plan to combat violence against women. Botswana made a recommendation. 73. Malaysia was encouraged by Sweden’s emphasis on economic, social and cultural rights and commended the Government for assuming all or most of the expenditure related to social services. Malaysia was also encouraged by the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination Act, which had led to the establishment of the Equality Ombudsman. Malaysia made recommendations. 74. Austria welcomed efforts to reform policies on national minorities, including with regard to language instruction, and asked about measures implemented under the new Act on National Minorities. Austria expressed concern at continuing discrimination against the Sami. Noting an increase in racially motivated hate crimes, Austria inquired about the reasons for the low number of prosecutions of such crimes. Austria made recommendations. 75. Moldova highlighted Sweden’s inclusion of the human rights pillar among the main thematic priorities of its development cooperation agenda, with a strengthened focus on support for democracy. Moldova inquired about the country’s vision of the future modalities for the implementation of universal periodic review recommendations. Moldova made a recommendation. 76. Colombia noted measures to combat discrimination in all its forms. It noted the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination Law, which promoted protection against discrimination based on sex, ethnic origin, religious or other beliefs, disabilities and sexual orientation. Colombia made recommendations. 77. Jordan noted that Sweden had been at the forefront in promoting gender equality and humanitarian assistance.

Jordan commended Sweden for that contribution and hoped that it would continue to pursue such goals. Jordan made recommendations. 78. Norway noted Sweden’s commitment and its achievements in reducing discrimination and promoting equality. However, Norway pointed out that both the Swedish Ombudsman against discrimination and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination had referred to discrimination against persons of foreign origin in terms of the labour market, health and access to housing. Norway also noted the slow progress with regard to the Sami people. Norway made recommendations. 79. Bosnia and Herzegovina asked about ratifying ICRMW and about establishing a national institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. It appreciated the methods used in investigating and combating discrimination and welcomed the action plans to combat violence against women and the disappearance of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. It was concerned that immigrant, refugee and minority women suffered discrimination. It asked about measures to combat racially motivated hate crimes. It made recommendations. 80. The Netherlands commended Sweden for its human rights record, but expressed concern at discrimination against the Sami and the Roma. It welcomed the National Action Plan to combat violence against women.  It noted concerns that the 2008 Surveillance Act might still interfere with the right to privacy. The Netherlands made recommendations. 81. Indonesia commended Sweden’s initiative to establish bilateral dialogues on human rights. It expressed concern at the publication of a poster of Prophet Muhammad and a blasphemous video message by a Swedish political party, which undermined the process of building trust and understanding among cultures. It noted that Sweden had not established a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. Indonesia made recommendations. 82. The United Kingdom welcomed Sweden’s efforts to strengthen the legislative framework for protecting human rights and the Act on National Minorities and Minority Languages. It noted the ratification of CRPD in 2008 and asked about improving awareness regarding the rights of the disabled. It welcomed Sweden’s work on children’s rights and the action plan for safeguarding children from sexual exploitation. The United Kingdom made recommendations.  83. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya inquired how parliamentary ombudsmen exercised control over civil servants who had committed offences and asked about the national monitoring of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, plans to establish a national human rights institution, and measures to combat racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, in particular Islamophobia. It made a recommendation. 84. According to non-governmental organization information, the rights of the Sami people were not clearly specified in the Constitution, and their right to traditional land and natural resources were not being respected. China asked about measures Sweden would take to address such issues. China noted the establishment of the institution on Roma issues and was interested in how Sweden would ensure the equality of the Roma people.

Philippines made recommendations.  87. Slovenia commended Sweden as an exemplary democratic country with functional legal and institutional systems and high standards of human rights, as well as its contribution to international development. Slovenia was concerned about the lack of comprehensive legislation addressing racism as a crime. Slovenia asked what concrete measures Sweden was planning to address that gap. Slovenia made a recommendation. 88. Burkina Faso recognized Sweden as a country continuously engaging in the promotion of human rights at both the national and international levels. Burkina Faso noted with appreciation Sweden’s commitment to promoting women’s human rights and gender equality, as well as to developing programmes for minorities and indigenous communities.  89. Bangladesh highlighted Sweden’s social security system and the fact that Sweden had reached the target of 0.7 per cent of official development assistance. It noted CERD’s concern about the absence of criminal law provisions against incitement to racial hatred. It asked about addressing the propagation of racial and religious hatred by publishing, in the name of freedom of expression. It noted CEDAW’s concern that immigrant, refugee and minority women faced discrimination and CRC’s concern about discrimination against minority children and child refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers. Another concern was child trafficking for sexual exploitation. Bangladesh made recommendations.  90. Palestine noted challenges, particularly in the areas of racial discrimination, violence against women and the protection of the rights of the elderly and persons with disabilities, but also took note of efforts made to protect human rights, including those of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, in addition to the rights of children.
