On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Morocco: Burkina Faso, Bangladesh and Italy. 3.

A list of questions prepared in advance by Denmark, Ireland, Slovenia, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden was transmitted to Morocco through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR.  I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process  A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The Kingdom of Morocco indicated that its national report under the universal periodic review (UPR) had been elaborated based on a participatory approach in which all the stakeholders concerned have contributed. This made it possible to grasp and appropriate the nature, foundations and goals of this mechanism. 6. Morocco renewed its commitment to continuing its cooperation with the United Nations human rights system, and openness to constructive dialogue and interaction with all its mechanisms, especially the Human Rights Council, treaty bodies and special procedures. 7. With a view to fulfilling its commitments related to the full interaction with and openness to the special procedures, Morocco received since its first periodic review the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Independent Expert on cultural rights and the Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law and Practice. These mechanisms visited many regions of the country, and noticed on the ground the achievements made in the areas falling within their scope of work in particular, and in human rights in general. Morocco will receive a number of these mechanisms, including the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture in September 2012. Morocco reiterates its openness to all thematic special procedures of the Council, and would facilitate their work in an unimpeded and unrestricted manner. 8. Morocco has attached special importance to the implementation of the recommendations made during its first review and responded to all those which were accepted. It ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and its Optional Protocol, the First and Second Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. 9. Furthermore, Morocco has already launched the process of ratification or adhesion to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT), the First Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil Political Rights, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It also signed the Third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on communications procedure, and embarked upon procedures to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 10. Moreover, it withdrew its reservations to the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which have become obsolete given the legislative reforms made, namely the Family Law and Nationality Act. 11. Morocco ensured that the measures and actions to prevent torture were strengthened in law and practice and that prison conditions were improved. It also saw to it that the Equity and Reconciliation Commission recommendations were implemented, particularly those related to truth, individual and community reparations, as well as the judicious recommendations on institutional and legislative reforms, which were all enshrined in the new Constitution approved by popular referendum on 1 July 2011. 12. Considering the fact that some recommendations fall within the reform process, especially those related to the promotion of human rights, human rights education and training, protection of the rights of migrants and completion of the harmonization of national laws with international human rights standards, Morocco embarked on its implementation, based on strategic human rights planning, pursuant to the 1993 Vienna Conference recommendation in this regard. This concerns mainly the elaboration and start of implementation of the Platform for Promotion of the Human Rights Culture and the elaboration of the National Action Plan on Democracy and Human Rights. 13. It should be noted that attention was accorded tothe recommendation on the adherence to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The new Constitution provides for the criminalization of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and all systematic and serious human rights violations. In addition, several crimes provided for in the Rome Statute are included in the Moroccan draft criminal code. Curbing impunity is also considered a strategic choice, which would enable the Kingdom to adhere to the international justice system. 14. Morocco has been engaged in a comprehensive reform process which culminated in the adoption of the new Constitution, whose guiding principles are the Royal Address of King Mohammed VI dated March 6, 2011. All the concerned stakeholders were involved in this drafting process which was a major step to ensure a real and effective democratic transition. 15. Human rights are the backbone of the new Constitution. They appear in all its chapters, including its preamble which is an integral part thereof. The new Constitution enshrines the concept of participative democracy, through the broadened pluralist and citizenship participation in political life and in the management of public affairs. With a view to consolidating democracy and giving a concrete content for the human rights protection guarantees, the new Constitution outlines key provisions on the separation and balance of powers, the guarantees to entrench the independence of the judiciary and to upgrade it to a real power, the principles and rules of active and responsive citizenship, the promotion of good governance and linking responsibility with accountability. 16. The new Constitution provided for advanced regionalization, starting with the Southern Provinces, allowing the local population to manage their own affairs and enhance local democracy, as a prelude to the implementation of the autonomy statute proposed by Morocco as a political solution to the Sahara dispute. 17. Pursuant to the Constitution, Morocco witnessed in November 2011 legislative elections which were fair, free and professionally organized, according to national and international observers. As a result, a new House of Representatives was elected and a new Head of Government appointed from a political party which used to be in the opposition, in a democratic and political alternation. 18. With a view to enabling Morocco to have a coherent, modern and effective national human rights system, the institutional framework responsible for the promotion and protection of human rights was reinforced. The Advisory Council on Human Rights was upgraded to a National Human Rights Council, with a stronger mandate and as a real redress mechanism with more action through regional mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights. The Mediator Institution was set up and replaced the Diwan al-Madalim (Ombudsman), with broader protection and proposal-making mandate to improve the performance of administration and public facilities. Many bodies have been constitutionalized and the National Commission for International Humanitarian Law and the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights was created. 19. Taking into account the role of the judiciary in the protection of freedoms and human rights, the Government with the support of the King has given particular attention to the reform of justice with all its components. In order to boost this project, a high instance in charge of organizing a national dialogue on a thorough and profound reform of the justice system was set up. All the parties concerned participate in this dialogue with a view to elaborating and adopting a national chart for justice. 20. Great efforts have also been made to better manage penitentiary institutions and improve their situation, in such a way as to ensure human dignity therein and increase the opportunities of training and reintegration of prisoners into society. The fact that these institutions are open to the visits of national human rights institutions has improved the situation and humanization of prisons. 21. In order to capitalize on the national gains in the areas of freedom of opinion and expression, a broad national debate on freedom of media and publishing has been launched. Morocco has also experienced broader exercise of the right of assembly and demonstration, in a context of pure political openness and democracy build-up. 22. Despite the challenges and difficulties facing the national economy due to the global economic crisis and the slowing growth of the economies of many countries worldwide, Morocco continued to fulfil its obligations arising from the implementation of economic, social, cultural and environment rights. 23. Considering the cultural diversity of Morocco, several constitutional gains have been achieved with regard to the enjoyment of cultural rights. The Amazigh language is considered as an official language of the State and a shared heritage belonging to all Moroccans, and a national council for languages and Moroccan culture is provided for. In addition, Morocco ensured that its efforts are enhanced to integrate the Amazigh and Sahrawi Hassani cultures in the areas of education, training, media, communication and cultural creativity. 24. Regarding womenÕs rights, Morocco has taken several measures to promote gender equality. It has combated gender-based violence and gender has been taken into account in public budgets, access to public services and facilities, and participation in the management of public affairs. In the field of group rights, several measures have been taken to ensure the rights of persons with disabilities, children, migrants and refugees. 25. Morocco underlined the importance of the progress achieved and that it would continue its efforts to accomplish further reforms in order to consolidate the rule of law and respect of all human rights. To that effect, it expected more support from the international community. Morocco hoped that this progress would be crowned by its election as a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2014Ð2016.  B.

It is true that Morocco was passing through real process of transition to democracy. In the context of this transition and for the first time, a constitutional document was issued, including rights and freedoms. There is a Parliament which was democratically elected. This election was observed by international and local observers. A Government of coalition was formed after the opposition won parliamentary election. Also, for the first time, Morocco also has a judicial authority, which is headed by the Higher Council for judicial authorities.

Some rights are now enshrined in the Constitution such as the right to access to water, environment and sustainable development and the Government has drafted a Charter in this regard. 73. The mandate of MINURSO is defined by the Security Council resolutions, starting from resolution 690 (1991) continuing to its resolution 2044 (2012), and the agreements between Morocco and MINURSO namely: supervision of the ceasefire and assistance in implementing programmes related to demining and confidence building measures. The recent resolutions are clear about the mandate of the MINURSO. With regard to human rights, resolution 2044 (2012) welcomed the opening of two National Councils on Human Rights Commissions in the Sahara, and the commitment to open further to all current special procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council. 74. The law forbids any violence against detainees. Coerced confession obtained through torture is inadmissible in court and is a crime. There are mechanisms for the prevention of torture and detainees have the possibility of access to a lawyer in the first hour of the detention. As of 2008, members of the prosecution increased their visits to prisons. Complaints of torture are investigated and prosecuted. Juvenile delinquents are judged by special judges in juvenile justice. There has been a national strategy to combat violence against women in force since 2002. Laws were revised to provide greater protection for women. 75. The right to housing is enshrined under the new Constitution. Morocco undertook sustained efforts to ensure access to housing for the greatest possible number of people and lowÐincome households. The Government is intensifying and diversifying housing by carrying out dedicated programmes in order to eradicate slums by 2016 through the construction of social housing, low and middle-cost houses. There is also a programme combating exclusion in the slums. ItÕs a public/private partnership with local communities and Ministries involved. The national human development programme is in its second phase, including combating poverty in rural and urban areas based on a participatory philosophy, active solidarity, the gender perspective and a constant desire to ensure that activities are located in their own territories, in particular where wealth is created. Morocco is achieving outstanding results, particularly for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 76.
