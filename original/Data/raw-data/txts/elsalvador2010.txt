The delegation of El Salvador was headed by the Vice-Minister for Integration and Economic Promotion of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Carlos Alfredo Castaneda Magaña. At its 8th meeting, held on 11 February 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on El Salvador.  2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of El Salvador: Nicaragua, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation.  3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were issued for the review of El Salvador: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/SLV/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/SLV/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/SLV/3).  4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to El Salvador through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 5. During the interactive dialogue, 42 delegations made statements. Recommendations made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report. A. Presentation by the State under review 6. The delegation of El Salvador acknowledged that the preparation of the national report had been a challenge, because the report had had to contain information about measures taken by two different administrations.  It also recognized that the Government bore a historical debt with regard to the fulfilment of its international human rights obligations. The administration is committed to incorporating into public policy the recommendations made by the United Nations human rights machinery. 7. The Government is establishing an internal consultation process for the possible ratification of the international instruments to which El Salvador is not a party, such as the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Moreover, in September 2009, El Salvador signed the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the internal ratification process is ongoing 8. The delegation laid out the legal framework for the guarantee of fundamental freedoms.  It highlighted a bill regarding access to information and transparency currently being considered by Congress, as well as the establishment, in 2006, of a tribunal on Government ethics. 9. Since 2000, there have been continuing efforts to prevent and combat torture through the screening of applicants to the National Academy on Public Security.  That measure has prevented the recruitment of security agents involved in violations of human rights and humanitarian law. 10. Several public institutions, such as the National Civil Police, created by the 1992 peace accords, and the Attorney General’s Office, are entrusted with ensuring public security.  The delegation acknowledged that the prevailing official policy, centred on police repression and the generalization of preventive imprisonment, has not worked and has caused the country to become one of the most dangerous in the region. The most vulnerable groups are women and girls under the age of 18.  The new Administration has taken extraordinary and temporary actions to control criminal activities and to prevent human rights violations. 11. With regard to the electoral system, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has taken a series of measures aimed at guaranteeing the right to vote for every citizen.  For example, a pilot programme on residential voting has been established, the participation of citizens with disabilities has been promoted, and the possibility of voting abroad is being considered. 12. In 2008, new procedural criminal, civil and trade codes were adopted.  Their implementation remains pending, owing to the need to train the legal profession.  13. The new Administration has reinforced and extended the “Red Solidaria” programme, aimed at combating poverty in those municipalities in which abject poverty is a severe problem.  The programme, now renamed “Comunidades Solidarias”, takes an inclusive and integral approach to improving the health, hygiene, nutrition and education of the families concerned.  The programme also incorporates a gender perspective, since women are the main administrators of its benefits, as well as a rights-based approach. Between 2004 and 2009, 106,000 families benefited from the programme. 14. El Salvador is closer to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, as indicated in its second progress report.   15. The illiteracy rate in El Salvador has fallen to 14.1 per cent, while average school attendance has reached 5.9 years, which is an improvement compared with 2004, when the rate was 5.6 years.  The Government is committed to improving those numbers.  The delegation highlighted the establishment of a Secretariat for Culture, which has replaced the former National Council for Culture and Art.  The Secretariat reflects an institutional upgrade, since it is directly under the President.   16. El Salvador’s legal framework will guarantee the right to health. In that context, the Government has taken steps, based on a human rights approach, to extend health coverage in rural areas and heavily populated urban centres.  Social security coverage has increased by 12.7 per cent, reaching 29.7 per cent of the economically active population and 23.9 per cent of the total population.  17. With respect to the right to work, the delegation explained in detail several programmes based on tripartite participation and aimed at generating employment opportunities, in particular for specific vulnerable groups such as young people, the elderly and persons with disabilities. On the other hand, El Salvador has lost 39,000 jobs because of the financial crisis. The Administration plans to create 100,000 new jobs through a temporary employment programme and the improvement of public and private infrastructure. 18. The national curriculums have incorporated principles of sustainable development. A new environmental administration paradigm is being promoted by the Government in order to mitigate social, economic and environmental risks related to natural disasters. 19. A total of 8,305 families have benefited from funds supporting the development of housing projects, while 8,153 families that were victims of the 2001 earthquake received new housing. Moreover, 41,047 families affected by Hurricane Stan and the eruption of the Ilamatepec volcano received property titles. 20. President Funes acknowledged that the victims of serious human rights violations committed during the armed conflict have the right to truth, justice and reparation, and recognized the importance of memory in guaranteeing that such acts would not be committed again. He also recognized the responsibility of the State and apologized for the serious human rights violations perpetrated by public officers. A commission has been established to propose to the President reparations for the victims. 21. In November 2009, the Institute for the Integral Development of Children and Adolescents launched a process for building a national policy aimed at the protection of those groups. It was a first step in identifying the most relevant problems affecting them. 22. The Government is committed to following the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and will encourage Congress to discuss the possibility of ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women. The delegation also referred to the national plan to prevent and eradicate domestic violence and explained measures aimed at combating violence against women and sexual aggression against girls. 23. El Salvador recognizes the existence of indigenous peoples, in particular the Nahua-Pipiles, the Lencas and the Cacaopera.   24. In 2005, a Vice-Ministry for Foreign Affairs for Salvadorians Abroad was established.  The new Administration intends to reinforce consular protection of the human rights of its citizens abroad, as well as respect for the human rights of foreigners in the national territory.  Since 2008, there has been a national policy aimed at eradicating the trafficking in persons.   25. The delegation also described the State’s policies and institutional frameworks aimed at persons with disabilities, the elderly and persons with HIV/AIDS.   26. It concluded its presentation by referring to the Government’s new approach to penitentiary administration, which, inter alia, encourages the participation of civil society in seeking solutions to overcrowding and other common problems.  The penitentiary academy plans to provide human rights education for all personnel. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 27. A number of delegations thanked the Government of El Salvador for its comprehensive national report, its inclusive preparation and its presentation. Some delegations also welcomed the positive steps taken by the country to consolidate the peace accords and the rule of law. Many States noted the importance of the 2009 presidential elections and recognized the commitment of the new administration to the promotion and protection of human rights.   28. Algeria welcomed the efforts made by El Salvador to consolidate peace and to promote human rights and to ensure that the events of the past will not be repeated. Algeria also welcomed the country’s efforts to combat poverty, as a result of which a number of communes with high poverty rates benefited in 2005 from food security, education and health services. Algeria made recommendations.   29. Cuba welcomed the efforts of El Salvador to combat poverty and further the realization of the right to food, the right to work and social security. It highlighted advances in the areas of education and health, including actions taken in rural areas; the extension of the hours of operation for health clinics in densely populated centres; the adoption of the National Education Plan for 2021; and the provision of free secondary school education. It also welcomed actions by the Government to prevent discrimination and protect vulnerable populations. Cuba made recommendations. 30. Slovenia noted that, although discrimination based on physical or mental disabilities is prohibited by law in El Salvador, the law had not been effectively enforced with regard to education, employment or access to buildings, and requested information about the measures that the country intended to take to eliminate such discrimination. Slovenia stated that, despite positive steps taken to guarantee children’s rights, it was alarmed by the reported numbers of children who had suffered physical abuse or lived in an atmosphere of domestic violence. It also stated that the Act on Child Protection does not explicitly prohibit corporal punishment. Slovenia made a recommendation. 31. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela welcomed the social policies implemented by El Salvador in order to protect and promote the human rights of its population. In that connection, Venezuela noted measures taken to combat poverty through employment, health, education and nutrition programmes, particularly for vulnerable populations. Venezuela highlighted the implementation of the Communities in Solidarity Programme in rural and urban areas, as well as the Government’s efforts to promote a system of universal social protection. Venezuela made a recommendation.  32. Ecuador highlighted steps taken to protect children and women in particular, as well as victims and witnesses.  It noted the willingness of El Salvador to work with other Governments of the region to protect persons crossing its territory in order to reach North America.  It asked about the status of the migration bill, as well as about the negative effects of the Free Trade Agreement on the most vulnerable groups of society, as observed by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.   33. Turkey stated that the establishment of the Attorney’s Office for the Defence of Human Rights was an important element in the strengthening of democracy and human rights and indicated that respect on the part of the relevant State institutions for rulings issued by the Attorney’s Office could be improved. It encouraged El Salvador to take into consideration the recommendations made by the Committee against Torture and welcomed the efforts made thus far to that end. Turkey encouraged the country to allocate greater resources to social development and to the fight against poverty. It welcomed the recognition of health as a fundamental human right and commended the progress made in reducing infant mortality. It also welcomed the absence of gender disparity in the area of education. Turkey noted with concern the prevailing high incidence of violence against women. It made a recommendation. 34. Canada expressed distress at reports implicating the National Civilian Police in unlawful killings, arbitrary arrests and detentions, as well as in the use of excessive force and the mistreatment of detainees. While noting with concern reported threats, harassment and killings of community activists and members of non-governmental organizations, it welcomed the intention to conduct a full investigation into recent deaths of community activists in Cabanas. It also noted that prison overcrowding and harsh and dangerous conditions threatened the health and the lives of inmates.

It stated that, in 2006, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights had noted with concern the discrimination faced by women and that, in 2008, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women had expressed concern at the pervasiveness of patriarchal attitudes and deep-rooted stereotypes, which constituted serious obstacles to women’s enjoyment of their human rights.

In addition to the adoption of that law, El Salvador recognized the need to develop a more comprehensive policy to deal with the serious problem of violence against women and children. The Government recognized the failure to produce complete, comprehensive national statistics on gender violence and stressed its commitment to develop such a statistical system. El Salvador further underscored the need to allocate special funding for these efforts within the security budgets at both national and municipal levels, and to include civil society organizations and local networks in the process. 51. El Salvador had been engaged in a technical discussion regarding the possible lifting of its reservations to the Cairo Plan of Action and would soon consider a final political decision on the matter. The Instituto de Desarrollo de la Mujer had been designated to lead national efforts to combat discrimination against women and girls, including by furthering the country’s compliance with the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and reactivating the legislative debate on the ratification of the optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Its institutional budget had recently been increased accordingly. 52. The delegation highlighted the fact that most attacks and threats made against human rights defenders were under investigation, adding that the complaints filed had enabled the Government to provide protection for a number of victims. The Government had further increased protection for the Ombudsman, who had also received threats, and had redoubled its efforts to strengthen that Office. 53. The President of the Republic had signed a decree establishing a national commission to search for children who disappeared during the armed conflict, in accordance with the standards set by the Inter-American Human Rights Court. El Salvador now recognized the full authority and binding nature of the Court’s recommendations and had moved forward with dialogues with the claimants in various cases currently being heard by the Inter-American Commission. 54. El Salvador mentioned its efforts to protect and guarantee the rights of persons with disabilities. It highlighted the fact that the Secretariat for Social Inclusion was tasked with promoting the human rights of groups generally excluded or marginalized, including persons with disabilities, senior citizens, children, indigenous peoples and persons affected by discrimination as a result of their sexual orientation.  55. France inquired how, when and under what modalities the Government would meet its commitments to recognizing and compensating the victims of the civil war and queried as to the exact mandate and composition of the National Commission to Search for Disappeared Children.

France made recommendations.  56. Belarus stated that, although El Salvador faced a number of problems in protecting human rights, the country was determined to continue to enforce the rule of law and to strengthen democracy.

Chile made recommendations. 58. Ireland welcomed with satisfaction the adoption of the Act on the Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents. Looking forward to its entry into force in April 2010, it regretted the lack of financial resources allocated for its implementation, particularly considering the high and disproportionate number of child victims of various crimes. Ireland expressed concern at the prevalence of violence against women and children, in particular cases involving violent death, sexual abuse and domestic violence. Ireland made recommendations.  59. Malaysia stated that, since the signing of the Chapultepec Accords in 1992, El Salvador had sought to create the conditions necessary to consolidate peace by strengthening democracy and the rule of law. Those efforts had resulted in the establishment of a number of institutions tasked with ensuring respect for human rights and their implementation.  Malaysia noted that the effects of the global and financial crisis, which had resulted in significant job losses, had had a negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights. Malaysia was encouraged to note El Salvador’s commitment to enhancing job creation, improving public services and upgrading infrastructure. Malaysia made recommendations.   60. Italy noted with satisfaction the non-application of the death penalty since 1973 and the abolition of the capital punishment for all crimes in 1983, except those under military legislation in time of war. Despite progress made in the area of women’s rights and the introduction of a national policy on women and a law on domestic violence, it noted the prevalence of a discriminatory attitude against women in society. The 30 per cent rise in delinquency in El Salvador in 2009, with high numbers of often unpunished murders of women, was worrisome. Italy made recommendations.   61. The United States of America appreciated El Salvador’s recognition of the cultural, historic and ethnic heritage of its indigenous people and applauded El Salvador’s interest in promoting the economic, social, and cultural development of those populations. The United States also applauded El Salvador’s work in designing and implementing a new humane model for prison administration and its decision to include civil society in finding solutions to problems in its penal institutions, as well as its outreach to disaffected young people through the creation of economic opportunities and social programmes. The United States of America made recommendations. 62. Germany requested information regarding the efforts to bring perpetrators to justice and the number of successful investigations into acts of violence. Germany made recommendations.  63. The United Kingdom recognized the serious challenges posed to the Government and society by high levels of violence and by criminal gangs, and noted that a slow and ineffective justice system, long periods of pre-trial detention and overcrowded and violent prisons might hamper efforts to bring perpetrators to justice. It welcomed the modernization project of the judicial system, including initiatives to update court facilities, bring justice to remote areas and train judges to more effectively prosecute organized crime. Acknowledging the development of a national policy on women, it remained concerned at reports of continued discrimination and violence faced by women, children and minorities and inquired about planned steps to address those concerns. It also asked about the involvement of civil society in the follow-up to the universal periodic review. It made recommendations.  64. Uruguay highlighted the efforts made by El Salvador in the field of human rights and the work that had been accomplished in the process of national reconciliation. Uruguay recalled invitations extended by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to strengthen cooperation with non.governmental organizations and civil society. In that connection, it welcomed the participation of civil society in the process of preparing the national report for the universal periodic review. Uruguay also welcomed the national policy for women and the law against domestic violence. Uruguay made recommendations. 65. Argentina noted El Salvador’s policies aimed at truth, justice and reparations for victims of human rights violations perpetrated during the armed conflict. It highlighted the official recognition that agents belonging to public institutions and other paramilitary organizations had committed serious human rights violations and abuse of power. In that regard, it inquired about the possibility of reflecting on the derogation of the amnesty law. Argentina also inquired about measures to decrease gender discrimination and eradicate violence against women, as well as about the possibility of introducing a gender perspective with regard to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.  It made recommendations. 66. Ukraine commended the efforts by El Salvador to protect and promote human rights, including by strengthening legislation, combating discrimination, promoting gender equality, protecting children’s rights and taking measures to combat poverty. It noted with concern the serious problem of femicide. Ukraine made recommendations. 67. Luxembourg congratulated El Salvador on the adoption of the recent law aimed at the protection of children and welcomed the recent improvements in the areas of school attendance rates, security and violence against women and children. It expressed concern at the high murder rates. Luxembourg highlighted the solid partnership it had established with El Salvador in terms of development and cooperation aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals. That partnership would promote the right to education, health care and good governance. Luxembourg made recommendations. 68. Iraq welcomed the Government’s participation in the Inter-American system for the promotion of human rights and noted the adoption of a number of laws in accordance with international standards. It requested information about available mechanisms for protecting the freedom of expression and the role of justice in that regard. Iraq made recommendations.  69. Guatemala congratulated the Government on its efforts to ensure compliance with the recommendations and decisions of the Inter-American human rights system. Guatemala noted that the working group against enforced disappearances had visited El Salvador in 2007, but that no report following its recommendations had been submitted by the Government. Guatemala highlighted the efforts of the Procuraduría General de la República and other institutions to provide access to justice, and asked about actions taken to ensure access to justice for indigenous peoples. Guatemala made recommendations.  70. China commended El Salvador for having taken measures to promote and protect human rights. It also commended the country for its efforts and achievements in terms of strengthening training for judicial personnel, combating poverty, raising the school attendance rate, improving public health, promoting social welfare to support poor families and protecting vulnerable groups. China noted that El Salvador was confronted with numerous difficulties and challenges in relation to its judicial system. China asked what specific measures would be adopted to address the lack of a rational legal system.   71. Slovakia expressed concern at the increasing number of attacks against human rights defenders, especially those criticizing the Government or important business groups, and encouraged the Government to guarantee their legitimacy and ensure their protection. It also noted that perpetrators were often not held accountable. It welcomed the abolition of the death penalty for ordinary crimes in 1983 and its non-application since 1973. With respect to conditions in detention centres and prisons, it deplored the lack of necessary infrastructure, which had resulted in overcrowding. Slovakia made recommendations.  72. Latvia noted with appreciation the open spirit of El Salvador in addressing human rights challenges. It welcomed the country’s announcement that it would extend a standing invitation to all special procedures of the Human Rights Council and invited all other countries to follow that commendable example. 73. Costa Rica recognized efforts taken by El Salvador to combat poverty and decrease inequalities in the country. It also welcomed the country’s system of universal social protection, which went beyond combating poverty and addressed, inter alia, food security, employment and economic development. Costa Rica encouraged El Salvador to continue its efforts to improve the living conditions of its population along those lines and to strengthen the gender perspective in all aspects of public policy in order to comprehensively address inequalities. Costa Rica made recommendations. 74. Bolivia noted remarkable education and health improvements since the new Administration had taken power.  It expressed understanding of the remaining challenges due to the legacy of the armed conflict and to imposed economic policies.  It made recommendations.  75. Poland appreciated the progress made by El Salvador in promoting and protecting human rights. It referred to the national policy on women for 2005-2009 and the solidarity network programme as among the recently adopted measures and stated that, nevertheless, serious obstacles to women’s enjoyment of their human rights persisted, as a result of a wider problem related to gender and domestic and sexual violence. Poland made recommendations. 76. The delegation of El Salvador referred to concerns regarding the minimum age for marriage, an issue that affected girls in particular and had been the subject of particular mention by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The Government stated that it would review the relevant legislation and propose legal reforms if deemed appropriate, in accordance with international human rights standards. 77. El Salvador emphasized its commitment to conducting timely studies on some of the concerns raised in the questions submitted in advance by delegations, including the need to bring the definitions of torture, enforced disappearance, gender-based violence and other crimes into line with international human rights standards. The delegation also underscored its willingness to share information about recent efforts to address the problem of violence, particularly as it affected vulnerable groups such as women and children. 78. The delegation acknowledged the failure of public security policies that, until recently, had been focused primarily on police control and repression, at the expense of crime prevention, attention to victims and the rehabilitation of offenders. El Salvador announced that it had launched a plan to develop a comprehensive public security policy. The new policy would focus on police control and greater control in prisons; addressing impunity for crimes committed by State agents; recovering public trust in the national police force; and the restructuring of the force, in accordance with the spirit of the peace accords. 79. El Salvador highlighted concerns about the problem of impunity and appreciated the recommendations made by States with a view to addressing that serious issue. The delegation stated that investigations into alleged human rights violations and other crimes committed by police chiefs were under way, and that a law to strengthen the Office of the Inspector-General was being discussed.  80. El Salvador reaffirmed its commitment to taking up the agenda proposed by the working group on enforced disappearances, which the Committee against Torture had recently reinforced, and concluded by expressing its appreciation for the recommendations, questions and comments made during the interactive dialogue. II.
