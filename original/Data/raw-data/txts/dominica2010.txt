These questions are available on the extranet of the Working Group. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. Crispin S. Gregoire, Permanent Representative of Dominica to the United Nations, introduced the national report. 6. The delegation indicated that the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Dominica is the Supreme Law of Dominica and its First Chapter guarantees the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. 7. The delegation indicated that the Constitution further provides in Section 16 (10), that any person alleging violation of any fundamental rights may apply to the High Court for redress. Appeal of any decision of the High Court may also be sought from the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, if necessary. 8. The delegation further highlighted that Dominica’s human rights infrastructure is comprised of both legal and institutional aspects. The legal aspects include the guarantees enshrined in the Constitution, the provisions of the Laws of the Commonwealth of Dominica, and Dominica’s international obligations. In terms of the institutional aspect, responsibilities are accorded to both governmental and non-governmental entities. The Ministry of Community Development, Information, Gender Affairs and Culture is the most active at the Cabinet level and employs a rights-based approach in the delivery of social services and the protection of vulnerable groups. While the Ministry of Community Development, Information, Gender Affairs and Culture bears responsibility for the promotion and protection for human rights, many other ministries have portfolios that impact on the enjoyment of those fundamental rights and freedoms including ministries with responsibilities for education, health, housing, urban development, youth, sports, economic development, labour and national security. 9. The work of non-governmental organizations has contributed in a significant way to civil society’s appreciation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country. The National Association of Non-Governmental Organizations, established in September 1996, has actively promoted the rights of free association and the role of civil society in national governance. The Dominica National Council for Women is the leading non.governmental advocate for the rights of women, and monitors compliance with obligations.  10. The delegation stated that it has made commendable progress in the advancement and promotion of women’s rights, gender mainstreaming, and the overall empowerment of women. In adherence to its commitments under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (Convention of Belem do Para) and other international conventions ratified by Dominica, successive Governments have been proactive in guaranteeing equality and non-discrimination in the treatment of women. 11. The delegation highlighted the ratification of the following treaties: Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) 1990; Optional Protocol to CRC on the involvement of children in armed conflict; Optional Protocol to CRC on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1993); International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1993); Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (Convention of Belem do Para, 1995); Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery. 12. In addition, Dominica has taken legislative action and passed the following laws: the Protection against Domestic Violence Act 2001, the Labour Contract Act which embodies the principle of equality between men and women and prohibits differences in rates of pay for the same work based on the gender of the employee and the Social Security Act which provides for 12 weeks maternity leave. Also, male public sector workers are now entitled to paternity leave pursuant to an agreement between the main trade union and the government signed in December 2008. The amendment to the Title by Registration Act to accommodate low cost transfer of property between spouses. This has given a tremendous boost to married women’s property ownership. 13. The delegation indicated that a National Gender Policy was completed in 2006 and ratified by the Cabinet in September 2007. This policy aims to achieve gender equality by eliminating discrimination against women in the policy arenas of health, economic development, violence-producing conditions, education and skills training, and power and decision-making. 14. A number of programmes and activities have been undertaken to give effect to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In terms of policy, a protocol on Joint Police and Social Services investigation into child abuse cases is to be established. A review process for the Status of Children Bill, and the Child Adoption Bill is underway while a new piece of legislation, The Children and Young Persons Act, seeks to incorporate specific provisions of CRC into domestic legislation. The Education Act No. 11 of 1997 has been amended to provide early childhood education for children from 0 to 5 years instead of from 3 to 5 years as was previously the case. The Protection Against Domestic Violence, Act No. 22 of 2001, contains specific provisions covering various forms of violence against children. In view of growing transnational crime in the Caribbean region, the Government of Dominica has been proactive in enacting legislation to make human trafficking a crime. 15. Dominica explained that the right to participation in cultural life is guaranteed in the Constitution and enshrined in the Culture Act of 1981. A National Cultural Policy was adopted by the Cabinet in May, 2001, which recognizes the richness and uniqueness of Dominica’s cultural heritage. Dominica has ratified a number of conventions related to culture and preservation of culture. A National Cultural Council exercises oversight over the protection and promotion of Dominican culture.  16. The delegation highlighted that the nation’s prime recognition of the elderly is asserted in the fundamental rights and freedoms that are to be enjoyed by all citizens under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Dominica. According to the 2001 National Census, older persons constituted 13.4 per cent of the registered population of 69,625. In 1999, the Cabinet adopted a National Policy on Ageing, and The Dominica Council on Ageing, established in 1993, exercises oversight over the implementation of the national policy on aging, and provides advice and input into Government policy making.  17. The Government’s strong advocacy in maintaining the fundamentals of total care for the elderly fostered the launching of a pioneering programme called the “Yes We Care Programme”. This programme is a system of home and community-based care. It seeks to blend with the lives and requirements of the elderly in a harmonious way, heralding further for better synergy and cooperation among the many service providers. In 2007, the Government announced the policy of free health care for persons 65 years and older and for youth 18 and under. After review, the Government in 2008 decided to lower the age of persons who could benefit from free health care services from 65 to 60 years. 18. The delegation stressed that the Government continued to improve the facilities at the Stockfarm Prison. A new cell block was completed in 2008 which has helped to reduce the serious problem of overcrowding. Separate facilities for juvenile offenders have been established, and a skills training programme has been established for them. The inmate population at Stockfarm Prison includes both remanded and convicted prisoners, and the staff of the facility has received training in rehabilitation, and exposure to counselling, which are available for the benefit of the inmates.  19. The first reported case of HIV/AIDS was diagnosed in 1987. Over the last 2 decades, Dominica has maintained a prevalence rate of 0.75%. From 1987 to 2008, the cumulative number of HIV infections stood at 342 cases, with males in the 25–44 age group representing 71.2% of the infected population. 20. In 2003, Government launched the five year National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS which is guided by the principle that the life of every individual is precious and valuable and therefore all attempts will be made to preserve the well being of the individual regardless of his/her health status, sexual persuasion or other personal characteristics. On the basis of this principle the response focused on the provision of treatment and care for persons living with HIV and AIDS and the prevention of transmission of the virus (among the general population, vulnerable populations, and from mother to child). 21. With 45.4 per cent of Dominica’s population under the age of 25 years, Government recognizes that youth development is critical to overall national development. The process of youth work in Dominica is based on achieving the Millennium Development Goals and adopting the Commonwealth Plan of Action for Youth Empowerment. The youth development programmes of Dominica seek to achieve “Youth Mainstreaming”, a systematic approach to integrating youth affairs with all relevant stakeholders. 22. The delegation pointed out that a vibrant system of local government has existed for more than one hundred years. The 41 local government authorities serve as conduits through which central government policy outputs, programmes, projects, and information impact on local communities. 23. The rights of Dominica’s indigenous people, the Kalinago, are enshrined in the Constitution, and the Carib Reserve Act of 1978. The Kalinago people live in the Carib Territory under a communal land tenure system which is governed by the Carib Chief and the Carib Council. 24. Central to Dominica’s development thrust is particular focus on the advancement of the indigenous peoples. At the United Nations, Dominica has been steadfast in its support of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and has been unwavering in its support for the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PFII).  25. The Government of Dominica has undertaken important initiatives to improve social development for the indigenous Kalinago people. The Ministry of Carib Affairs was formally established in 2005. Its creation, and the policy direction of its Minister, the Honourable Kelly Graneau, the elected Member of Parliament for the Carib Territory, has contributed to the heightened attention which Government accorded to comprehensive development of the Kalinago people. Much emphasis has been placed on improving housing conditions, and providing greater opportunities for training at the secondary and tertiary levels. 26. Government signed the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities on March 30, 2007. An initial consultation with the primary advocate for rights of the disabled, the Dominica Association of Disabled People and other key stakeholders was held in 2008 to familiarize implementing organizations with the obligations under the Convention and to assess the country’s readiness for its implementation. Further discussions are planned with a view towards ratification of the Convention. 27. The Government of Dominica is committed to ensuring the right of every Dominican to quality education. The education system is governed by the 1997 Education Act, which makes education compulsory for any person between the five years and fifteen years of age. Dominica has attained Universal Secondary Education. 28. Dominica noted that it received a number of advance questions from Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.  29. The delegation referred to several questions raised by Argentina. It highlighted that corporal punishment in schools is hardly used, even though it is still in the law. Furthermore, the delegation noted that attempts are being made to have separate courts for juveniles. Concerning the minimum age for employment, the delegation noted that it is actually 16 years. The delegation addressed concerns regarding its indigenous people, the Kalinago, and noted that they are accorded the same rights as others. In terms of access to Government services, there is no discrimination based on ethnic origin. Furthermore, the delegation added that many laws have been enacted to towards elimination of violence against women. Dominica highlighted that the Ministry of Gender Affairs is working with the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) to satisfy the outstanding reporting obligations to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2010.  30. The delegation referred to several questions raised by the Czech Republic. The delegation highlighted that a standing invitation for the special procedures of the Human Rights Council was under consideration. Concerning the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocols, the delegation noted that the cabinet in Dominica had to address the ratification of the Convention. The delegation highlighted that the Government had passed legislation to implement measures to strengthen its human rights obligations. The delegation referred to the fight against discrimination against children with disabilities and Carib-Indian children and noted that Dominica was facing significant challenges in that regard. While there were two schools located in the capital that provided education to children with disabilities, children with disabilities in rural areas still had limited access to education. The delegation pointed out that Carib-Indian children did not face discrimination in Dominica. 31. The delegation referred to several questions raised by Denmark, concerning the improvement of the Rights of the Child, in relation to issues such as sexual abuse and corporal punishment. The delegation pointed out that there is a specific law in Dominica’s Sexual Offences Act, which addresses sexual abuse. Dominica had a number of cases before the court and several perpetrators have been sent to prison. Concerning corporal punishment, the delegation noted that it is hardly used in the school system. Although the delegation noted that it is a problem in families. It pointed out that this is an arena Dominica still needs to work at, and that the Government will have to look towards possible amendments in this regard.  32. The delegation referred a question raised by Latvia concerning standing invitation for the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. The delegation noted that this is an issue for the cabinet of Dominica to decide on. It highlighted that Dominica is open for the Special Procedures and that Dominica has no problems with Special Rapporteurs to their country.  33. The delegation referred to two questions raised by Sweden. The delegation pointed out that Dominica has not executed the death penalty since 1986. It furthermore noted that Dominica has a very low murder rate and that all death penalties have been commuted to life sentences. The delegation highlighted however that an abolishment of the death penalty remains problematic, and that it would require a referendum. Sweden asked Dominica about the Sexual Offences Act, which criminalizing consensual sexual activity of person with the same sex. The delegation noted that this is a challenging area and that the delegation recognized that it is discriminatory. However, the delegation noted that this is an issue that the cabinet has to deliberate on. The delegation admitted that there is a certain element of discrimination in the society towards same sex relationships.  34. The delegation referred to questions raised by the United Kingdom about the role of civil society in the preparation of the national report. The delegation noted that the preparation process had been a little hasty and that consultation with civil society had been limited. Dominica had only been able to have consultations with a few non-governmental organizations s and community-based organizations. The delegation noted that it would have preferred to have broader consultations with non-governmental organizations s.

The United States made recommendations. 38. Algeria welcomed Dominica’s efforts to promote the right to education, particularly for poor children. Algeria noted the establishment of specific programs, the allocation of funds and the free distribution of textbooks to help poor children, which shows a determination to give full effect to the right to education. Algeria was aware of the climatic and economic difficulties which affect efforts to ensure the full and effective implementation of economic, social and cultural rights. Algeria finally recalled that environmental, social and economic vulnerability have made Dominica among the poorest countries within the Eastern Caribbean. Algeria made several recommendations. 39. Venezuela noted the efforts underway to promote and protect human rights, particularly the indigenous populations, which is the largest in the Eastern Caribbean.

Turkey indicated that it was convinced that Dominica will continue to address its commitments to promote and protect human rights.  42. Maldives stated that it understood the severe technical and financial capacity constraints faced by Dominica and the knock-on effects this has on the promotion and protection of human rights. It also stated that improved reporting under those conventions for which Dominica is a party, the ratification of core treaties, selective engagement with Special Procedures, and the establishment of national human rights institutions, are essential building blocks for progress in human rights. Maldives made a recommendation. 43. France expressed concern that the incidence of domestic violence in Dominica remains worrying, with over 20 per cent of women having allegedly been victims of ill-treatment by their spouses. France recalled that perpetrators of marital rape cannot be prosecuted until the spouses have been legally separated and that police response in such cases is not fully satisfactory either. France asked what measures were being envisaged by the authorities to remedy to this situation. It also recalled that Dominica has not submitted any periodic reports to the Human Rights Committee, to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.

Argentina noted as positive the conception and approval of the national action plan for gender equality. Argentina made recommendations. 59. Latvia noted with appreciation Dominica’s good human rights record, its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and the openness with which it approached the UPR dialogue. In particular, Latvia appreciated the response given by Dominica in its introductory statement regarding the issue of sanding invitations to the Special Procedures. Latvia made a recommendation. 60. Jamaica appreciated he efforts of the Dominica to promote and protect the human rights of all its citizens, especially those persons who constitute vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities. Jamaica indicated that the indigenous Kalinago people, although comprising a small segment of the population, are of great historical and cultural importance. Jamaica commended Dominica for having introduced universal secondary education and hoped that the plans for universal tertiary education will soon be realised. It noted that several reports to treaty bodies are overdue and that this was a reflection of the constraints faced by many developing countries and underscores the need for technical and capacity-building assistance if they are to adequately meet their commitments. 61. Trinidad and Tobago thanked Dominica for its sustained efforts in strengthening the provision of human rights for its citizens. It noted that Dominica boasts a multiparty, parliamentary democracy with a strong tradition for the rule of law, which is reflected in the country’s respect for all facets of human rights and, more importantly, is exemplified in the adherence of Dominica to the principles that define modern democratic statehood. Trinidad and Tobago acknowledged that challenges still exist with respect to a variety of issues such as ensuring fair and equitable treatment for the indigenous Kalinago peoples, ensuring gender equity and reducing corruption. It noted, nonetheless, that despite resource constraints, efforts are being continually made at the level of policy and practice, to redress any existing inequities with the establishment of a Ministry of Caribbean Affairs headed by a Kalinago, the existence of a Gender Bureau and the establishment of a commission to implement the Integrity in Public Service Act of 2004.  62. Djibouti noted with satisfaction that many measures have been taken in order to improve access to justice. It particularly welcomed the Legal Aid Programme, established in 2003, which allows marginalised families to access legal advisory services. It welcomed the initiatives taken to combat all forms of human rights violations. It highlighted, in particular, the recent activities to eradicate violence against women, such as the Protection against Domestic Violence Act. Djibouti stated that it is fully aware that Dominica is facing many challenges in promoting and protecting human rights and called upon the international community to provide technical assistance to Dominica in order to achieve the millennium development goals. Djibouti made recommendations. 63. Bangladesh stated that it fully understood the formidable challenges Dominica faced due to it being a small island developing country which is exposed to serious environmental, social and economic vulnerabilities. These factors impede the efforts of the country in realising the human rights of its people. Concerns expressed by the treaty bodies especially in the areas of health, education, safe drinking water and other concerns, can only be effectively addressed if root causes, as identified are taken care-off. Without resources, Dominica will not be able to provide health care, education, access to safe drinking water, adequate housing and employment. It will not be able to make progress in the areas of political rights highlighted by many states. Dominica is doing its part and the international community must extend a helping hand in complimenting Dominica’s efforts. 64. Dominica thanked the President and was grateful to all the speakers that have spoken and stated that they were well aware of all the human rights reality and welcomed all the questions and recommendations put forward. 65. The delegation referred to a few broad categories of questions and recommendations in its response. On the question of ratification of human rights conventions that have not yet been ratified, the delegation mentioned the Convention on Elimination of Racial Discrimination and stressed that Dominica will be looking at this convention very seriously. The Convention on Torture was also an important one and Dominica will look at the other human rights conventions that have not yet been ratified. 66. The delegation indicated that Dominica will be making every effort to produce the report for the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2010. The delegation agreed that that was an arena that needed to be addressed. 67. As far as amendment of legislations, the issue of the death penalty was not the easiest issue to deal with because there was a societal value attached to that and given the increasing crime in the country, even though Dominica has the lowest crime in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the issue of the death penalty was one that the delegation could agree, at the minimum, to a moratorium. As stated before, there was a de facto moratorium on the death penalty and no one was executed since 1986. The delegation believed this will continue. As to whether the death penalty can be abolished, was an issue for the Government to decide and the delegation could not make any comment in this regard. 68. In respect of the other challenges, Dominica’s highest priority was to fight poverty and giving equal treatment to people in all the arenas and in other sectors whether in health or education. Dominica called on the international community to continue to engage with us it address those social developments. The delegation referred to the problem of HIV/AIDS and welcomed the support from international entities – such as the Global Fund, and bilateral support received from many countries. Dominica’s problem was that in a few years time when the funding ran out, with the commitments that have been made, Dominica will be expected to shoulder that burden. That will be an enormous challenge.  69. The delegation was very pleased that they have reached this far in this engagement with the Human Rights Council on the human rights equation and Dominica endeavoured to work very closely with the Council. Dominica was open to having engagement with Special Procedures mandate holders. There were no major human rights problems and it was open to having the international community come in and help to understand the problem and to address them whether it is in the area of legislation, such as getting technical assistance to deal with amending its laws or writing new laws.
