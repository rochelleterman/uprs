The review of Costa Rica was held at the 11th meeting, on 5 May 2014. The delegation of Costa Rica was headed by Gioconda Ubeda Rivera, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship. At its 17th meeting, held on 8 May 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Costa Rica. 2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Costa Rica: Argentina, Botswana and Viet Nam. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Costa Rica: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/CRI/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/CRI/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/CRI/3).  4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Costa Rica through the troika. The questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). A summary of additional questions posed during the interactive dialogue by Angola, Canada, France, Ghana, Hungary, Iceland and Italy can be found in section I. B below. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. Costa Rica indicated that it was a great responsibility to report on its compliance with and implementation of its international human rights obligations. In its second national report, Costa Rica had provided information on the follow-up to the recommendations received in 2009. In 2010, it had presented an additional document with its position on the recommendations, and in 2012 it had presented a midterm report on progress made and on specific compliance with some of the recommendations.  6. In preparing the second national report, 21 institutions from the executive branch, which together formed the Inter-Institutional Committee on Follow-Up to and Compliance with International Human Rights Obligations (CIIDDHH), had been involved. The judicial branch, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Supreme Electoral Court and the Legislative Assembly had also participated as observers. CIIDDHH had now been institutionalized as a mechanism for consultation and dialogue, through an executive decree, and with a permanent consultative body for civil society. 7. Costa Rica was pleased to report that, since the previous review, it had ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CPED), the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning decent work for domestic workers and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. It had also signed the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP.ICESCR), which the delegation hoped would soon be approved by the Legislative Assembly. 8. Costa Rica was a middle-income country that, since 1949, had consistently invested in education. In 2011, Costa Rica had achieved a literacy rate of 97.6 per cent. The country had also a programme of cash transfer which was conditional on students remaining in the formal education system. Costa Rica hoped to increase the income of poor families, thus paving the way for access to education and ensuring universal secondary education. That would also be a step towards reducing poverty, combating the school dropout rate, addressing examination failure and tackling child labour. 9. Costa Rica had an internationally recognized quality universal health system, which was reflected in the average life expectancy of 79.3 years and in the low rate of child mortality. In 2011, 97.5 per cent of the population had their own water supply and nine out of ten persons had drinking water. The right to water had been recognized by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and in March 2014, a new law on water resources had been approved on first reading. 10. Despite the aforementioned progress, Costa Rica faced challenges stemming from the structural situation which was reflected in the levels of social inequality and inequity, as well as the increasing level of organized crime in the region. 11. The delegation reported on a number of important mechanisms that had been established or strengthened, and legislation, policies and programmes that had been adopted for the care and protection of the most vulnerable population groups, thereby promoting social inclusion. 12. The rights of children and adolescents had been seriously affected by increase in sexual exploitation, sexual abuse and adolescent pregnancy, in particular when they were linked to abusive relations with adults. The lead body in that area, the Patronato Nacional de la Infancia (National Child Agency), conducted policies, programmes and projects for the comprehensive protection of minors and their families, in coordination with other institutions and non-governmental organizations. Nevertheless, it was important to continue strengthening those programmes. 13. Costa Rica was also working to mainstream a gender perspective in all areas and had carried out a number of initiatives in State bodies to build a society based on the principle of gender equality. 14. With regard to specific population groups, the State had had to take targeted measures for indigenous peoples, persons of African descent, migrants and refugees. As part of the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance held in Durban, and following the 2009 Durban Review Conference, Costa Rica had been pleased to announce that it had adopted a National Policy for a society free from racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia and a related Action Plan for 2014Ð 2019. There was currently also a proposal for a reform of the Constitution which would declare Costa Rica to be a multi-ethnic and pluricultural nation. 15. Costa Rica had a strong judicial system which granted rights to persons regardless of their nationality, and which was strengthened through numerous rulings of the Constitutional Chamber, guaranteeing the effectiveness of the standards related to the migrant population. Furthermore, over the previous four years, Costa Rica had been developing a new Migration Act and a comprehensive migration policy with a human rights perspective in order to achieve the integration of the migrant population in society. As a result, the conditions of migrants in Costa Rica had significantly improved between 2000 and 2011. 16. Regarding the refugee population, Costa Rica had a long humanitarian tradition and long-standing experience in the integration of refugees. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) collaborated closely with Costa Rica. 17. Costa Rica had also been discussing ways to guarantee the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) population. Activities were being carried out and initiatives were being developed in which civil society had played a fundamental role. 18. Another area in which the role of civil society had been important was the promotion and protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. Following the first UPR cycle, Costa Rica had promulgated a series of executive decrees which sought to improve the living conditions of persons with disabilities.  19. The delegation briefly referred to the national institutions which guaranteed compliance with international human rights standards in Costa Rica. Reference was made to the existence, since 1989, of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court and of the Office of the Ombudsman, which had been created in 1992, and had been accredited with A status by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. The delegation also reported that, in compliance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT), in 2014, Costa Rica had adopted a law to create the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture, which would contribute to reducing overcrowding in prisons and improving living conditions for detainees. The new preventive mechanism was administratively assigned to the Office of the Ombudsman, but was financially and operationally independent, which guaranteed that it would function without any interference. Reference was also made to the National Coalition against Illicit Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons, which was made up of 21 public institutions. B.

However, the issue would be taken up again with greater impetus; Costa Rica therefore appreciated the recommendations that had been made in that regard. 61. Responding to comments made by Ecuador, Costa Rica indicated that it would not be able to accept recommendations or statements that were not based on reality. It was possible that there had been isolated cases of discrimination against migrant workers, which happened in every country, but it would not accept that there were no xenophobic policies in place and no systemic xenophobic actions taken. 62. In line with the voluntary commitments undertaken by Costa Rica during the last review, and under the framework of the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, Costa Rica had adopted the National Policy for a society free from racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, which aimed for an inclusive and more respectful society that embraced sociocultural and ethnic diversity. The Policy was the result of a joint process involving the State and civil society, based on the principle of Ònothing about us without usÓ and targeting persons of African descent, indigenous or native peoples, migrants and refugees. The process had taken place under the framework of CIIDDHH and supported by OHCHR. 63. Costa Rica recognized that it faced challenges regarding indigenous peoples. The existence of a favourable judicial framework was insufficient to ensure full protection of the rights of communities if it was not accompanied by State policies and actions which sought the effective application of and compliance with the standards to which the State itself had committed. Costa Rica shared information about a recent positive experience with indigenous communities in the south. 64. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination had made various comments and recommendations to Costa Rica relating to the situation of indigenous peoples, particularly since 2011. Those recommendations echoed the concerns and claims of the indigenous peoples and coincided significantly with the efforts that the State was undertaking to address their situation. 65. Ghana welcomed the measures taken to improve care and respect for the elderly and improve access to water and sanitation by all.

It hoped that Costa Rica would soon submit its overdue reports to treaty bodies. 83. Costa Rica had implemented a series of initiatives to build a society based on the principle of gender equality. One example was the establishment of the 2007Ð2017 national policy, which had the support of womenÕs organizations and other sectors of civil society. Costa Rica had also developed gender equality policies in several national institutions and provided training on gender sensitivity. Steps were being taken to combat gender stereotypes through the media. In accordance with the recommendation in paragraph 91.2 of the previous report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic (A/HRC/13/15), the National WomenÕs Institute (INAMU) had disseminated a first report on the situation of womenÕs rights in 2011. 84. In response to concerns raised by some delegations on the issue of violence against women, the delegation said that Costa Rica had established a High Level Commission to monitor compliance with the Violence against Women Act and a comprehensive care system for victims. In addition, abuse and assault against women had been criminalized in 2011, an internal register of perpetrators had been created, the initial period of protection measures had been increased to one year, access to justice for victims had been strengthened and the criminal authorities had been authorized to apply measures in the absence of specialized domestic violence courts. In 2013, an emergency plan had also been drawn up to reduce gender-related murders of women. 85. In response to concerns raised by some delegations, Costa Rica indicated that the protection and promotion of the human rights of children were a fundamental pillar of State action. The National Policy for Children and Adolescents 2009Ð2021 set the strategic focus of the State to promote, protect and ensure the human rights of all children. 86. Costa Rica had also established a national strategic framework entitled ÒRoad map to make Costa Rica a country free of the worst forms of child laborÓ, which promoted coordination among initiatives that had a direct or indirect impact on the prevention and eradication of child labour. 87. The rights of LGBTI persons was a challenging area for Costa Rica. There had been increased interest in the debate on the recognition of the rights arising from same-sex unions. Concerning the recommendation made by Spain relating to the right of transsexual persons to identify themselves in keeping with their gender identity (A/HRC/13/15, para. 91.4), Costa Rica noted that in 2010, the Supreme Electoral Court had issued a decree providing that everyone had the right to enjoy respect for their image and sexual identity when a photograph was taken for their identity card. Costa Rica acknowledged that changing cultural attitudes was a challenge. A protocol on harassment, bullying and cyberbullying in secondary schools had also been prepared. 88. Costa Rica indicated that a subsystem of indigenous education had been established by the Ministry of Public Education. With the support of the World Bank, Costa Rica had invested in infrastructure in indigenous territories and had prepared an educational programme. 89. Administrative actions had been taken to address prison overcrowding. Some detainees had been allowed to complete their sentences using non-custodial measures and efforts had been made to improve conditions in some prisons. The State recognized that there were still significant improvements to be made. 90. In order to address trafficking in persons, the Act on Trafficking and Related Activities had been promulgated, establishing the National Coalition against Illicit Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons. The Act provided for increased punishments for the abduction of minors, and criminalized sexual tourism and labour exploitation. The penalty for labour exploitation was more severe if the victim was under the age of 18. The Act also established procedures for the care of minors and the right of victims to bring civil actions for reparation. The National Coalition was made up of 21 institutions. The Act provided for the establishment of a specific fund which was financed by taxes to be paid by all tourists and nationals when leaving the country. Information campaigns were being carried out in the area of prevention. 91. Responding to several questions on the international jurisdiction of crimes categorized in Costa Rican legislation, the delegation said that such crimes included the possession and production of pornographic material depicting minors, and human trafficking and smuggling. The Penal Code, in article 6, established the possibility of applying Costa Rican law to punishable acts committed abroad in various cases, including when the consequences of a punishable act were felt fully or partially in Costa Rica, or when the perpetrator of a punishable act committed abroad was a Costa Rican national. 92. Montenegro welcomed progress regarding efforts to address violence against women and the implementation of a High Level Commission to monitor compliance with the Violence against Women Act. It welcomed steps to combat human trafficking. 93. Morocco commended Costa Rica for its openness.

It commended the creation of CIIDDHH. 100. Peru appreciated the efforts made by Costa Rica, in particular, the ratification of CPED, the creation of CIIDDHH, the establishment of the national plan to address racial discrimination and xenophobia and efforts to address trafficking in persons. It offered to share its experience on regulating the right of indigenous peoples to be consulted. 101. The Philippines welcomed efforts to implement the UPR recommendations through national mechanisms and the adoption of legislation concerning violence against women and trafficking. It acknowledged the progress made with regard to migration issues. 102. Portugal welcomed the establishment of CIIDDHH and measures to protect persons who suffered from persecution in their countries of origin owing to their sexual orientation.

It suggested that Costa Rica should reduce prison overcrowding. 108. Sierra Leone noted that Costa Rica provided a good example of the results that could be obtained when military spending was diverted to development. It was concerned by the high incidence of trafficking in children and urged Costa Rica to raise the age of sexual consent to 18 and to develop new strategies to reduce the prison population. 109. Singapore noted that achievements in combating violence against women had helped to reduce the number of gender-related murders of women. It also acknowledged the emphasis Costa Rica placed on improving access to health care, especially for women. 110. Slovakia welcomed efforts to improve human rights protection, including for children.
