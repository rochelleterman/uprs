It welcomed the entry into force of the law on the legal status of churches, religious communities and religious groups. However, it noted that there were still reports of restrictions and discrimination against certain religious communities that affect their ability to practice their faith.   70. Bosnia and Herzegovina, referring to reports, hoped that the Government would fulfil the specified human rights priorities at the national and international levels in the future. It noted the development of national strategies and action plans to address human rights challenges in the areas of the judiciary, gender equality, Roma rights, children’s rights, cooperation with the civil sector and trafficking in human beings and asked for more information on their implementation.  Further information was  requested, inter alia, on steps to ensure the complete independence of the Ombudsman’s Office in terms of funding; and the achievements and implementation of the United Nations plan of action for the World Programme for Human Rights Education. 71. Belgium welcomed the positive measures adopted by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the area of the rights of the child, particularly concerning access to education. It, however, noted concerns by treaty-monitoring bodies regarding high levels of absenteeism in primary and secondary schooling and  low levels of school enrolment for certain population groups such as the Roma and asked how the Government assesses the current situation. Since the national plan on the rights of the child was foreseen for a nine year period, Belgium asked how the Government plans to conduct  regular evaluations and adapt to changes on the ground.   72. The Republic of Moldova noted, inter alia, that the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture recommended to the State to ensure that the Office of the National Ombudsman is fully in accordance with the Paris Principles and asked about measures taken in that regard. With regard to domestic violence, particularly alternative methods for the protection of victims, the Republic of Moldova asked about the mechanism for funding the Network of Centres for domestic violence victims. 73. In response to the questions on the national human rights institutions (Czech Republic, Brazil, India, Ukraine, Poland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary), the delegation stated that  the Office of the Ombudsman was established in 1997.  With the amendments to the Constitution of 2001, the Ombudsman was tasked with paying particular attention to safeguarding the principles of non discrimination and equitable representation. This will be additionally reflected in the new Law against Discrimination. With the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the Ombudsman has been designated as national preventive mechanism. The Government will consider the ways of ensuring its compatibility with the Paris Principles in particular regarding independent finansing.  74. As regards freedom of speech and independence of media  (Norway, Switzerland and Greece) , the delegation thanked for the number of recommendations proposed. The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press. In the area of broadcasting and the media, there is an independent regulatory body, the Broadcasting Council, which has the licensing authority. There are 6 television stations broadcasting nationally and 46 local ones. There is a huge number of independent radio stations and a growing number of news agencies and independent news portals. As far as the print media are concerned, there is a large number of dailies and weeklies. None of them is under Government control. In 2007, changes were made in the criminalization of defamation, libel and slander. There are only fines provided for by the law in such cases. These cases are brought to court based on private suits. 75. Addressing roots of ethnic violence and foster tolerance and respect for ethnic diversity  (United States), the efforts in this area, in addition to the already presented, will focus on the area of education. For the purpose of fostering inter-ethnic tolerance, the Ministry of Education will change curriculums and introduce the subjects in multiculturalism, cooperation for peace and tolerance. These courses will be attended by all ethnic groups together and are supposed to enhance social cohesion. The delegation informed of the MDG Spanish Fund project, the aim of which is to enhance interethnic dialogue and coexistence especially in the area of education and local level, to be implemented soon.    76. Regarding the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (United Kingdom, Mexico, Turkey, Croatia), the Government plans to ratify this Convention by the end of this year, after inclusive consultation with the civil sector working in this area. Furthermore, the Government is considering the establishment of Ombudsman for persons with disabilities. II. CONCLUSIONS AND/OR RECOMMENDATIONS 77.
