Presentation by the State under review 5. In the introductory statement, the head of the Turkish delegation noted the benefit of the present review for Turkey and thanked all stakeholders who had contributed to the process and those countries that had submitted written advance questions. In the preparation of the national report, civil society consultation had been given priority. Inputs received at a consultation meeting in December 2009 and through an appeal on the webpage of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been decisive in determining the report’s priorities. It was intended that that cooperation would continue. New developments had occurred since the submission of the report owing to the dynamic human rights reform agenda in Turkey.  6. Turkey considers the protection and promotion of human rights as a political priority. An extensive reform process, which included two constitutional amendments (2001, 2004), nine reform packages and new Civil and Penal Codes, was undertaken while struggling against terrorism. The Reform Monitoring Group, composed of several ministers, played a leading role in the process.  7. Turkey has adopted universal standards in amending legislation, accelerated the ratification of international conventions and intensified the training of law enforcement personnel and other civil servants, which has resulted in a complete change in mindset. Accession negotiations with the European Union started in 2005. In 2009, Turkey applied to become an observer of the European Fundamental Rights Agency.  8. Article 90 of the amended Constitution stipulates that, in the event of conflict between the provisions of national legislation and international agreements, the latter will prevail.  9. Capital punishment, which had not been applied since 1984, was totally abolished in 2004. 10. In 1987, Turkish citizens were granted the right to individual application to the European Court of Human Rights. Its compulsory jurisdiction was recognized in 1990. Judgements are translated and distributed to relevant institutions, their impact and results are assessed, the necessary preventive measures are taken and, once they are final, compensation is paid to the relevant parties. 11. New constitutional amendments in May 2010 included positive discrimination for children, the elderly, persons with disabilities and relatives of martyrs; personal data protection; the obligation to take all measures to prevent child abuse; the establishment of an ombudsman institution; the granting of the right to individual application to the Constitutional Court; the introduction of collective bargaining rights for civil servants and public employees; and the introduction of judicial scrutiny of decisions of the Supreme Military Council and the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors.  12. The judicial reform strategy and related action plan, finalized in August 2009, are aimed at enhancing the independence of the judiciary, its neutrality, productivity, efficiency and professional competency. An important element was the introduction of intermediary courts of appeal in civil and administrative justice.  13. A national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles, which will concurrently serve as the national preventive mechanism under OPCAT, will be established. Constitutional obstacles on the Ombudsman Law have been removed. A draft law on a new law enforcement agency independent complaint mechanism is under way.  14. A draft law on a non-discrimination and equality board, based on international standards, has been prepared. The grounds of non-discrimination include, inter alia, sexual identity, disability and ethnic origin.  15. Turkey is a State party to the anti-corruption conventions of the United Nations, the Council of Europe and OECD, and actively participates in GRECO of the Council of Europe. A national anti-corruption strategy and its action plan were adopted in 2010.  16. The delegation emphasized that important steps in the protection of human rights had been taken over the past decade and, while noting the need for further legal and administrative measures, expressed its determination and its political will to pursue its efforts. B.

Cyprus made recommendations. 24. Azerbaijan welcomed Turkey’s “zero-tolerance policy” against torture and noted the establishment of the Commission for Equal Opportunity between Women and Men.

The right to freedom of assembly for such persons was confirmed by case law of supreme courts, and all hate crimes were considered unacceptable, including those on grounds of sexual identity.  36. In order to ensure equality in practice, Turkey collaborated with representatives of, inter alia, the Alevis and the Roma, and was reviewing the curriculums in order to eliminate any discriminatory items.  37. Various dialects and languages traditionally used were taught in private courses and at newly founded university departments, and broadcasts in languages such as Kurdish and Arabic were available.  38. With the Lausanne Peace Treaty, Turkey had assumed responsibility for the protection of non-Muslim citizens as minorities. Any ethnic, racial, linguistic or other groups were not recognized as such. Minorities benefited from positive discrimination, including teaching in mother tongue in minority schools. The new Law on Foundations had brought about important progress for foundations in acquiring property, engaging in international activities and obtaining financial aid. 39. Gender equality before the law was a constitutional principle. Honour killings were punished by aggravated life sentences, and initiatives to protect women from violence were ongoing.  The Inter-ministerial Monitoring Committee on Violence against Women and the Women and Men Equal Opportunity Parliamentary Commission had been established in 2005 and 2009, respectively.

Since March 2010, refugees had been exempted from paying residence fees and granted the right to asylum until the date of their deportation. 92. Relevant legislation was being aligned with international standards, and Turkey was working on a new asylum law.

In March 2009, it had signed the European Convention against Human Trafficking and established a taskforce to review its legislation. Trafficking had been recognized as a crime in 2002, and the definition in the new Turkish Penal Code was in line with the Palermo Protocol. The concept of forced prostitution had been added to the definition in 2006. Redrafting was under way in order to overcome the implementation problems experienced with article 79 of TPC, so that an attempt to traffic would be sufficient for penalizing such acts.  95. The National Action Plan to combat human trafficking envisaged extensive measures for the rehabilitation of victims, such as providing shelters for their treatment and care, ensuring their safe and voluntary return to their countries, training law enforcement officers and protecting witnesses. The second national action plan to combat trafficking had been approved in 2009.  96. Turkey had issued a standing invitation to special procedures in 2001 and closely cooperated with international and regional human rights mechanisms.  97. The delegation noted that legislative work aimed at the harmonization of trade union legislation with ILO and European Union standards was continuing with the cooperation of the social partners. Restrictions on the right to freedom of assembly and to strike had been removed, and Turkey had signed the Decent Work Country Programme with ILO in 2009. Labour law provided for the prohibition of all forms of discrimination in employer.employee relations, including discrimination regarding gender and pregnancy. For women employees, a social security employer premium could be paid out of the unemployment fund for five years. Certain products manufactured by women were exempted from the income tax, and positive results had been obtained through microcredit projects. Sexual harassment in the workplace was a crime punishable by two years of imprisonment and gave the worker the right to revoke her or his work contract. 98. The Turkish delegation reiterated its well-known position with regard to the Cyprus question; referred to document A/HRC/13/G/4 that had been circulated; recalled that Turkey did not recognize Republic of Cyprus; reaffirmed that legitimate presence of Turkey on the island was the result of its obligations and rights stemming from the Treaties of 1960; noted that negotiations between the two parties on the island were ongoing under the auspices of the United Nations. 99. In conclusion, the head of the Turkish delegation thanked all participants in the dialogue and emphasized that all questions and recommendations would be carefully assessed.
