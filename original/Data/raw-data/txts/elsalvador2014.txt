The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of El Salvador was held at the 2nd meeting on 27 October 2014. The delegation of El Salvador was headed by Carlos Alfredo Castaneda, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 October 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on El Salvador. 2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of El Salvador: China, Ethiopia and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of El Salvador: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SLV/1);  (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SLV/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SLV/3).  4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to El Salvador through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review.  I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process  A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The delegation stated that the preparation of the oral presentation was the result of consultations between different government institutions, coordinated by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 6. The second review has allowed El Salvador to take stock of progress made in human rights since its first universal periodic review in 2010. The recommendations received and the voluntary pledges put forward on that occasion had shaped some objectives established by the Government, which had contributed to the reconstruction of democracy. 7. The progress identified had not prevented the Government from acknowledging that El Salvador was a country facing several challenges that needed to be overcome before it attained the full enjoyment of the rights of its people, in compliance with its human rights obligations. 8. The Government had a firm commitment to work for the strengthening and protection of human rights as part of State policy and as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. The new Administration was inaugurated on 1 June 2014, after the Salvadoran people expressed its will through a democratic exercise. The new Government was working on the validation of its five-year development plan, as the main guiding public policy tool. As part of the validation of the plan, the Government had launched a broad public consultation process, which included the Salvadoran community abroad. 9. The institutional focus of the Government of President Salvador S‡nchez CŽren was the strengthening of the structural achievements of recent years, which had improved the living conditions of sectors of society that had been excluded and impoverished for decades. 10. During its first universal periodic review, El Salvador committed to ratifying several international instruments. In that regard, the delegation noted that in 2011, El Salvador had ratified the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) and in early 2014, it had also ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty (ICCPR-OP2). In addition, the Legislative Assembly was in the process of considering ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED), the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 11. The Executive had also engaged in inter-agency consultations regarding the possible ratification of other instruments, including the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT). In that context, the Government had submitted for the consideration of the Legislative Assembly a draft piece of legislation to lift the reservation of El Salvador to the Convention. In addition, the definition of torture had been amended in 2011 to make the crime imprescriptible and include all acts of torture, as defined by the Convention. 12. Internal consultations were also under way to consider the possibility of becoming a party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention against Discrimination in Education; International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions No. 169, 189, 97 and 143; the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity; the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty and the Inter-American Convention against All Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance. 13. At the domestic level, there had been some developments in the construction of a legal framework that would extend the recognition of the rights of particularly vulnerable sections of the population and the Government had established some institutions and mechanisms to monitor human rights. 14. For instance, in June 2014, the Legislative Assembly had ratified the amendment to article 63 of the constitution to add a clause recognizing indigenous peoples, for whom, in that framework, policies which respect and develop their identity, world view, values and spirituality will be set up. 15. Also, after extensive consultations with organizations of persons with disabilities, the National Policy on Comprehensive Care for Persons with Disabilities had been adopted in April 2014 and the Legislative Assembly was debating the possible lifting of the reservation to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Furthermore, sign language had been recognized as an official language. 16. In relation to older people, the Government had carried out a consultation process to substantially revise the Act on Older People, under a human rights approach. That reform would soon be introduced in the Legislative Assembly. The delegation added that El Salvador was a strong supporter of the negotiations for a regional and an international instrument for the protection of the rights of older people. 17. The fight against poverty and social exclusion were priorities for the Administration. Since 2009 the Government had established various programmes and measures that were part of the universal social protection system. In that regard, the Legislative Assembly had adopted, in April 2014, the Law on Social Protection and Development which established the right of the whole population to receive a minimum of social public services. 18. In 2010, El Salvador had launched a reform of the national health system, based on community family health teams, which guaranteed the right to health using a strategy of providing comprehensive primary health care and which worked directly with families and communities. The Government had also worked to raise awareness of the importance of vaccinating children and the whole family. 19. In March 2012, the Legislative Assembly passed a law on medicines, aimed at ensuring the availability, registration, quality and safety of medicines, promoting fair prices for medicines and their rational use as well. 20. The delegation also pointed out that El Salvador had already reached the Millennium Development Goal 5 target related to the reduction in maternal mortality. 21. In relation to people with HIV/AIDS, there was a proposed law for a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS which, it is intended, will establish an approach that goes beyond the consideration of that epidemic as a health problem and contribute to the elimination of discrimination and stigmatization. 22. On the other hand, El Salvador was committed to protecting the rights of Salvadorans who had migrated. In that sense the delegation considered as a great achievement the adoption, in 2011, of the Special Law on the Protection and Development of Salvadoran Migrants and Their Families. Also, in that context, the Government had strengthened, as a priority, the consular network since 2009. The delegation informed the Working Group that, more importantly, in the 2014 elections Salvadorans abroad were able to vote for the first time. 23. The delegation pointed out that, in June 2014, the migration flow of unaccompanied children and adolescents toward the United States of America had dramatically increased, because of false expectations generated by human traffickers, the longing for family reunification and the lack of opportunities and insecurity in El Salvador. That outflow was rated internationally as a humanitarian crisis. 24. El Salvador had sought to coordinate efforts to cope with that international humanitarian crisis with the countries of the northern triangle of Central America. And in July 2014 the Government had launched an awareness campaign and information about the risks that unaccompanied children faced when undertaking such a dangerous journey, under the slogan ÒDo not put their lives at riskÓ. The campaign materials were being distributed and discussed in all schools in the country. 25. The Administration had also signed the Special Declaration on the situation of Central American unaccompanied migrant boys, girls and adolescents to the United States and, within the framework of the Organization of American States, El Salvador had sponsored, along with Guatemala and Honduras, the adoption of a declaration on  Central American unaccompanied migrant children. 26. Public security and peaceful coexistence required the joint efforts of the Government and the participation of different actors and sectors of society. For that purpose, the Administration had established, in September 2014, the National Council for Citizen Security and Coexistence, composed of local governments, the business sector, people with experience in the field, political parties, the media and the church, in order to promote dialogue and agreements that would develop into sustainable public policies on the issue. 27. The delegation mentioned that, among the measures to address the security challenges, El Salvador was a party to the Central American Security Strategy, an instrument that from a comprehensive perspective guided the coordinated actions on security adopted by the eight countries in the region. 28. El Salvador had also focused its efforts on fighting crime and corruption and promoting transparency. Hence, a number of laws had been adopted: Law on Access to Public Information, Special Law for Intervention Telecommunications, Law against Money and Asset Laundering, Special Law on the Forfeiture and Administration of Goods of Illicit Origin or Destination and Government Ethics Law.  29. In addition to that important legislation, the Administration had sponsored the development of technological tools, such as the portal on transparency and open government, and the adoption of public policies and mechanisms of social control, such as accountability of public institutions and citizensÕ participation. 30. The fight against trafficking had also been a priority for El Salvador. The National Council against Trafficking was the body responsible `for the formulation of policies and the establishment of a political and strategic long-term framework for a comprehensive approach to trafficking. El Salvador announced with satisfaction that it had already adopted a Special Law against Trafficking in Persons. 31. Fighting crime was associated with another problem faced by El Salvador: prison overcrowding. On this issue, the Government had already received a number of recommendations from the Rapporteur on Persons Deprived of Liberty of the Organization of American States and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention after their visits in 2010 and 2012 respectively. In addition, the Legislative Assembly was considering a draft law that would allow the use of alternative technologies to ensure surveillance and attendance of persons charged in a judicial process. 32. In conclusion, the delegation recalled that El Salvador had been elected to the Human Rights Council for the first time in its history, which, it added, was an acknowledgment of the progress and achievements of the country in recent years. El Salvador was committed to the strengthening of the international system of human rights and in particular, the full consolidation of the Human Rights Council. El Salvador was extremely grateful for the trust it had received during the elections to the Human Rights Council.  B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 33.

There were however remaining challenges to protecting children better, to the extent that such a specialized system would be progressively implemented and the population made use of it. 94. While it was important to continue making improvements, progress had been achieved in the education sector. Early childhood was a government priority. As school attendance was linked to food and children social conditions, programmes ensuring food, clothing and school supplies had been implemented. 95.

In concluding, the delegation acknowledged the second cycle of the universal periodic review as an opportunity to share achievements on human rights.
