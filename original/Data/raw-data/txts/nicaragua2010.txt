At its 6th meeting, held on 10 February 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on Nicaragua. 2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Nicaragua: Brazil, the Philippines and Zambia. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were issued for the review of Nicaragua: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/NIC/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/NIC/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/NIC/3).  4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Nicaragua through the troika. The questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The delegation of Nicaragua stated that the national report had been drawn up by an inter-institutional commission under the coordination of the President’s Office with wide consultations and participation of all sectors of society. The report allowed Nicaragua to identify both strengths and shortcomings to be overcome in order to guarantee human rights to all Nicaraguans. 6. The universal periodic review process provided Nicaragua with a unique opportunity to share its national experiences and to highlight what it had done to promote human rights and exchange good practices. Nicaragua expressed the conviction that the recommendations resulting from the review would be based on the successful experiences of other States and serve to support specific proposals that Nicaragua could adapt to its own situation. 7. Nicaragua became a member of the Human Rights Council in the belief that consensus, dialogue and cooperation were fundamental tools to strengthen its system for the promotion and protection of human rights.  In Nicaragua, the promotion of human rights means making each individual aware that he or she has human rights and can enjoy them. A person who does not enjoy access to health, education, food or appropriate housing is deprived of a decent and free life. The protection of human rights is an obligation for all States. Protecting means guaranteeing that everyone has the same living standards, are all equal before the law and that the recognition of violations brings with it the right to reparations for victims. 8. Nicaragua has an array of international instruments, many of which it is a party. However, being a party to these instruments is not sufficient if States do not display political will and true commitment to implementing obligations entered into these instruments.  The primary responsibility and obligation to promote and protect human rights rests with the State. Nicaragua was fostering strategies to promote human development, thereby eradicating the poverty inherited from exclusionary social and economic policies. However, a nation deprived of the right to development is condemned to living in poverty and underdevelopment. States would not be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals as long as international cooperation was limited and politically conditioned.  The full enjoyment of human rights could not be provided as long as international trade continues to be unjust. As long as there were multinationals more powerful than States themselves, nations such as Nicaragua would continue to be impoverished. The capitalist system had failed the entire world, as could be seen from the financial and economic crisis. 9. Nicaragua was victim of a 16-year-old system that limited people’s rights. Poverty deprived Nicaraguans of the possibility of a decent life.  Thousands of Nicaraguans had been forced to migrate, thus exposing themselves to suffering and oblivion. 10. Nicaragua had set as a priority recovering for the Nicaraguan people the rights that were denied. Nicaragua has a national human development plan for 2009-2011, which provides for development strategies and a vision of human rights, without discrimination of any kind.  It included a national system for well-being and social equity, with clear policies and programmes regarding food, health, education, social housing, drinking water and social security.  With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, the main challenge was fighting poverty. 11. In 2007, the Government successfully promoted a programme of food production vouchers to benefit 75,000 rural families over a period of five years through a mechanism of transfers, which provides them with means of production.  The programme was extended to the “zero usury” financing programme. 12. Food security had become crucial in an international setting experiencing a world crisis. In Nicaragua, the right to food was constitutionally guaranteed.  The Parliament recently approved a law on food and nutritional sovereignty and security, allowing Nicaragua to set up complementary programmes such as the “zero hunger” programme, the food production vouchers scheme, housing vouchers, schools and market gardens, programmes for comprehensive food and child nutrition, and school lunches and milk programmes. Various United Nations agencies, including the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, have recognized the programmes as models of good practices. 13. Education was totally free of charge. Between 2006 and 2009, in solidarity with Cuba, Nicaragua supported the programme, “Yes, I can!”, with which it had reduced illiteracy in the country to less than 5 per cent, a situation certified by UNESCO.  It had established five educational policies to improve the quality of the educational system and to decentralize it.  Nicaragua had also a sustainable school food programme cited as model programme by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 14. Nicaraguans had equal access to the right to health. The State prohibitedall charges for health services. .   Nicaragua had managed to reduce the mortality from tuberculosis to half of the level recorded in 1990. Since 2007, Nicaragua had reached a low-risk level category for malaria. It has recorded 78 municipal areas out of 153 where there was no transmission of malaria. Since 2008, it guaranteed anti-retro-viral treatment for 734 HIV-positive people. 15. Labour had been recognized as both a right and a social responsibility. The State provided for full and productive employment for all Nicaraguans.  The unemployment rate was 8 per cent for the total economically active population. Reducing the rate of unemployment was a priority of the human development plan. 16. The right to housing had been a constitutional right since 1987.  Nicaragua had introduced a policy with guidelines for granting subsidies and for the establishment of secure mortgage funds, the establishment of credit funds and a bank for construction materials, as well as programmes for legalizing the right to property, particularly housing projects, and the recent agreement with private banks for the expansion of these social housing programmes through the investment of $90 million. 17. Social security was a constitutional right. Through the national plan for human development, the Government was currently working on a proposal for further changes to the current system. 18. The right to a healthy environment was also a constitutional right. The national human rights plan had adopted principles providing for the defence and protection of nature and the environment. Among the wide-ranging programmes in this area, Nicaragua was currently implementing the fourth programme directed and guided in a sustainable way for dealing with national forest ecosystems. Another initiative was the natural resources programme, aimed at providing drinking water supplies and the treatment of waste water, increasing reforested land areas, and the improvement and expansion of protected areas. 19. With regard to civil and political rights, the Government was focused on strengthening the rule of law and legal security.  It was promoting a national agreement in the area of criminal justice, with policies and strategies to strengthen the criminal justice system.  Nicaragua was seeking a fair and accessible criminal justice system that would preserve and foster the principles of legal security. Through this important process, the new criminal procedural code had gone from inquisitorial to an adversarial system. 20. The Nicaraguan police had a sense of belonging to the community. Deep respect for human beings and human rights was a cross-cutting principle of police doctrine. A recent report on human development concerning civil security drawn up by the United Nations Development Programme recognized that the police enjoyed credibility and was is one of the best police forces in Central America, showing that Nicaragua was one of the safest countries in the region. 21. The prison system was based on the penitentiary regime law and the law on execution of sentences, which provided that their activities be carried out in conformity with constitutional principles, laws and regulations, the code of conduct and international human rights instruments ratified by Nicaragua. 22. Gender equality and the proper position of women in all sectors of society were fundamental and had a cross-cutting foundation. Priority was given to the role played by women in decision-making and in the development of public policies allowing women to be empowered, thus helping to eradicate violence against women. The State had decided to establish units within its institutions tomonitor women’s rights through the “love programme”. 23. Nicaragua was striving to ensure that children were given the right to a happy life and to guarantee to them free social services. The State had enacted a code on childhood and adolescents, implementing a new model for juvenile criminal justice system, which guaranteed due process of law and was orientated towards integrating adolescents into families and the society. By reforming the criminal code, Nicaragua had moved from a penalty-oriented justice system towards a juvenile justice system with a rehabilitative emphasis. 24. In Nicaragua, everyone was equal before the law and had the right to equal protection by the law. The new criminal code defined and criminalized discrimination as an offence. Nicaragua was multi-ethnic in nature, and the State recognized the existence of indigenous peoples, who were entitled to the rights sets out in the Constitution.  The State had enacted a communal property law for indigenous peoples in the autonomous regions of the Atlantic coast, the development of which was part of the national development plan and a major pillar in its strategy. 25. In order to ensure the implementation of the plan, the Government had institutionalized a development secretariat for the Atlantic coast that is responsible for coordinating autonomous regional councils with national ministries. In 2009, the State had restored to two indigenous communities of the Caribbean their right to ancestral lands, granting 12 land titles that represent 12.8 per cent of the national territory, benefiting 152 indigenous and Afro-descents communities comprising 58,000 people. In the rest of the country, the State had handed over 56,868 title deeds, restoring lands rights to more than 262,562 people. 26. Nicaragua had ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the protocol thereto. The law on the prevention and rehabilitation of people with disabilities was being reformed to bring it into line with the Convention. In 2008, Parliament had adopted the law for the protection of the rights of persons with mental illnesses. Nicaragua, in solidarity with Cuba, was implementing through public health centres a care programme for these groups called “All of us with you”. 27. The new criminal code had decriminalized sexual relations between persons of the same sex and thus provided for the right to free sexual orientation. The Office of the Prosecutor for the Defence of Human Rights had recently appointed a special prosecutor for sexual diversity. 28. The Constitution recognized the right to freedom of association without discrimination and the right to freedom of expression in public and private, individually and collectively. In Nicaragua, all citizens enjoyed full freedom of expression. There is no censorship of any type.  A law guaranteed access for all to public information. State institutions, through the Office of Coordination of Public Information, guaranteed implementation and compliance with the law. 29. The Government took this opportunity to denounce the media campaign against the Government of Nicaragua by owners of media and opposition political parties; for example, during the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, his statements were subjected to manipulation and censorship by the media, which prompted the United Nations to publicly rectify the information. 30. Nicaragua had a model of media ownership that allowed for the existence of small-and medium-sized owners, with full freedom of expression and no censorship. There were 340 radio broadcasts and more than 70 television channels and cable companies. were are more than 20 press publications in circulation, including newspapers and magazines, as well as electronic publications. 31. Regarding abortion, legal amendments reflected the exercise of sovereignty, and had been adopted by the parliamentary majority in the national assembly.  This was clearly an issue of sovereignty, not a religious one. The majority of Nicaraguans believed that the right to life of the unborn was important. Those who opposed the amendment could seize the courts; in fact,many cases had been brought before the Supreme Court to challenge the constitutionality of the amendment, remedies which were still pending. Medical staff were not forbidden to provide medical care when the life of the mother was in danger. B.

The female population was 2,250,000. Legislators had not included the crime of femicide in the Penal Code, but it was punished through existing legislation, with penalties from 15 to 30 years of imprisonment. Aggravating circumstances included abuse of authority and discrimination on the basis of gender. 59. Nicaragua was more concerned with family violence and injuries, which in 2009 amounted to 9,213 cases, including sexual abuse, harassment, sexual exploitation, incest and rape. Nicaragua had established a special structure within the police to care for victims of these crimes (women and children police stations). At the end of the 1990s, Nicaragua had 35 national delegations, 21 of which at the department level, seven were municipal and seven were district offices for the capital. Together with civil society organization and procurators, Nicaragua had established seven shelters for victims of family violence with the aid of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation. 60. Nicaragua was implementing a gender policy leading to the empowerment of women and encouraging preventive action in the political, economic and organizational fields. A total of 327 training activities had been conducted on the law of equal opportunities, gender violence, security for citizens and family violence, prevention of violence and citizen participation model, including indigenous and Afro- descendant populations. 61. Regarding prisons, United Nations minimum standards are observed.  There were eight centres with 4,742 places currently occupied by 5,952 detainees.  Overcrowding rates amounted to 25.52 per cent.  Nicaragua faced the challenge of improving detainee living conditions.  In 2007 and 2008, studies were conducted on pre-investment in two new prisons. 62. With regard to training and work in penitentiary system, 1,200 employees (98 per cent of penitentiary officers trained in human rights) had been trained. 63. A total of 75 per cent of police officers had been trained in human rights and to fight corruption. 64. Regarding the legitimacy of the electoral process, the Constitution stated that the right to vote was guaranteed by the electoral branch. Free and transparent elections had been held.  The revolutionary Government submitted itself to the scrutiny of universal suffrage in the 1990s. Electoral law was at the constitutional level, supervised by an independent supreme regulatory body.  Elections were held at the national, municipal and regional levels.  The supreme electoral body has recently adopted a new regulation for international electoral observers, based on principles of sovereignty and non-interference. 65. The Office of the Procurator for the defence of human rights had been established according to the Paris Principles and was totally independent of State institutions and the Government.  It was currently operating in an appropriate way. A number of special prosecutors had been established for vulnerable groups. 66. Regarding the prosecution of human rights defenders, Nicaragua was concerned that, as a result of a media campaign against the Government, inaccurate information had been disseminated.  There was no policy of prosecuting human rights defenders. Nicaragua was actively working to protect the work of human rights defenders. In Nicaragua, there were approximately 5,200 registered non-governmental organizations working to defend human rights, and tensions may be attributed to divergent points of views sustained by the organizations supporting government policies and those opposing them. Incidents had been investigated by the internal police investigative unit and prosecutors. 67. Belgium commended the ratification of the second Optional Protocol to International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The situation of human rights defenders was cause for concern, since violence, threats and intimidation, sometimes even by public authorities, were frequent and remained unpunished. It asked about measures to allow human rights defenders carry out their activities freely and peacefully. Belgium was concerned about the criminalization of all forms of abortion, even when justified for therapeutic reasons, in cases of rape or incest. It made recommendations. 68. Finland thanked the efforts to keep up with the reporting requirements of treaty bodies. While appreciating the actions to improve gender equality, Finland noted that the norms and practices did not comply fully with international human rights treaties. It regretted that the electoral law for autonomous regions excluded the population of the Zelaya Central province. Finland asked how Nicaragua guaranteed the right of the people of Zelaya Central to choose their representatives freely in the autonomous government, and about measures to enforce women’s rights. Finland made recommendations. 69. Azerbaijan welcomed Nicaragua’s ratification of a number of international human rights instruments, its open invitation to special procedures, and the establishment of a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris principles. It asked Nicaragua to provide information on meeting the Millennium Development Goals and measures to combat human trafficking. It made recommendations. 70. Israel noted the reforms, particularly the human development plan, to guarantee the promotion and protection of human rights, as well as the efforts madeto reduce poverty, malnutrition and illiteracy. Israel was concerned that human rights violations remained prevalent, including harsh and overcrowded prison conditions; disrespect for the rule of law; widespread corruption; the erosion of freedom of expression or opinion, press, assembly and association; violence against women and children; domestic and sexual violence; and discrimination against ethnic minorities and indigenous communities. It made recommendations. 71. Sweden asked about the measures to prevent maternal and infant mortality as a result of illegal and unsafe abortions. Sweden referred to reports on the discrimination of indigenous people in areas such as education, health services, election participation and land rights. Sweden made recommendations. 72. The Netherlands was pleased that Nicaragua was party to the majority of core human rights conventions and had issued a standing invitation to special procedures. It also noted the efforts made in the fields of economic, social and cultural rights by providing health and education accessible to all. It made recommendations. 73. Nepal appreciated the efforts to take development and human rights together. It highlighted the establishment of national institutions and legislative measures on human rights.

It commended the steps taken to combat all forms of discrimination by decriminalizing same-sex relations. It made recommendations. 76. France noted with alarm the many reported cases of judicial harassment, physical intimidation and death threats of human rights defenders. It asked about measures to ensure their protection and to allow them to carry out their activities. It noted that Nicaragua forbade abortion in general, including therapeutic abortion.
