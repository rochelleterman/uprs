Presentation by the State under review 5. At the 4th meeting, on 3 February 2009, H.E. Dr. Dipu Moni, Minister for Foreign Affairs, made an introductory statement. Her presence at the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in her first overseas undertaking as Foreign Minister of a newly elected Government underlined the importance her Government attached to the guarantees of the inviolability of fundamental rights provided for in the Bangladesh Constitution. 6. She highlighted significant developments since the presentation of the national report, particularly the lifting of the state of emergency and the holding of free, fair parliamentary elections in the country. The 2008 parliamentary elections, held under a non.party caretaker government, had witnessed the participation of an unprecedented number of voters. For the first time, more women than men had cast ballots. The electoral process and the outcome were unreservedly lauded by observers from home and abroad. The state of emergency was lifted weeks before the elections, which resulted in full restoration of fundamental rights. 7. Bangladesh thanked the international community for its support in the country’s democratic transition. The Grand Alliance led by the Awami League had won the elections with a huge margin, and its election manifesto was clear on the issue of promotion and protection of human rights by stating that Bangladesh shall spare no efforts in realizing that goal. 8. The National Report was a result of broad consultations with representations of various stakeholders, and the consultations with civil society had been particularly rewarding as their perspectives had helped shape government positions on a range of issues.  9. A number of institutional reforms undertaken to strengthen rule of law and good governance were highlighted, including separation of the judiciary from the executive.  10. Reference was made to the establishment in 2008 of a National Human Rights Commission, a three-member body headed by a former Supreme Court judge and including a distinguished woman from civil society and a representative from a minority community. The Commission was empowered to receive and investigate allegations of human rights violations from any individual or group and to monitor the overall human rights situation in the country and make appropriate recommendations. 11. The reconstituted Election Commission had completed the registration of 80 million voters, with photographs and biometric features, and. the Rules of Procedure of the Anti Corruption Commission had been refomulated. Bangladesh would ensure independent functioning of those institutions, and would adhere to its commitment to the United Nations Convention against Corruption and bring corrupt people to justice.  12. The delegation stressed that economic and social rights were of paramount importance: eradication of poverty was the Government’s top priority and more than half the budget had been allocated for poverty-reduction activities. As a result of these and other efforts, poverty declined significantly. Bangladesh was often cited for its best practices of social safety net programmes and the Government had plans to further widen the social safety-net, particularly to combat the impact of the global financial crisis. The Government’s emphasis on education was also highlighted: the education sector received the single largest share, about 15 per cent, of the annual budget. 13. Bangladesh expressed its commitment to food security for all, emphasizing that it had been able to contain the impact of the global food crisis and highlighting its strategy both to reduce food prices further by increasing domestic production and to ensure greater access to agricultural inputs that would improve farmers’ productivity and income. 14. The delegation noted the Government’s intention to institute comprehensive police reform. Steps were being taken to update and improve the Police Act of 1961. A draft ordinance developed through consultations with all stakeholders stipulated codes of conduct for the police, with a particular focus on upholding human rights in the discharge of duties and on gender guidelines for the treatment of women and children. The process of setting up a victim support centre and a criminal intelligence analysis unit was under way. 15. One of the Government’s foremost goals in the field of human rights was to bring to justice all those who committed the most atrocious crimes against humanity during the war of national liberation. The Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, had already indicated that Bangladesh would seek United Nations help to ensure that the mechanisms adopted for the proposed trials of the perpetrators met international standards and safeguarded the basic principles of justice. Parliament had passed a unanimous resolution that there would be a trial of the perpetrators and the victims may expect redress. Bangladesh was committed to reversing the culture of impunity that had afflicted other areas of its national life. The Government intended to resurrect due process, expunge extra-judicial modalities and objectives, and promote political harmony and reconciliation. 16. Regarding the status of specific groups, the delegation indicated that women in Bangladesh were increasingly assuming leadership roles at both national and local levels, and that the principal focus had been to eliminate gender disparities in areas of law, economics, politics and family. An Inter-Ministerial Committee co-ordinated the implementation of CEDAW’s provisions, resolute action had been taken to stop violence against women, and One-Stop Crisis Centres (OCC) established in all six Divisions for victims of violence provided victims with emergency medical treatment, police assistance, legal aid, and shelter facilities. 17. The delegation provided information on recent amendments to the Citizenship Act. According to the Bangladesh Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2008, children born of a Bangladeshi woman married to a non-Bangladeshi were now entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship. The delegation also referred to special measures taken to address feminization of poverty, including the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) Programme with nationwide outreach covering nearly 750,000 poor rural women. 18. Concerning children, reference was made to the National Plan of Action against Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children, including Trafficking, and to the National Social Policy on Alternative Models of Care and Protection for Children, which would harmonize national laws on juvenile justice with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Bangladesh had eliminated child labour from the readymade garments sector, and this remained a noted case for global replication. 19. Among government measures aimed at the development of religious and ethnic minority groups, a separate Ministry had been set up for the tribal communities residing in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. It was mandated to uphold social, economic, cultural and educational rights of the hill people. 20. Bangladesh was attentive to the rights of the persons with disabilities. It had established 46 Focal Points in government ministries and departments to deal with disability issues.  21. Both print and electronic media played a role in protecting citizen’s fundamental rights. The existence of some 544 daily newspapers, 357 weeklies, 62 fortnightlies and 93 monthlies was an example of a vibrant print media.  22. Bangladesh acknowledged that the contribution of civil society and NGOs to national socio-economic development and to the promotion and protection of human rights had been praiseworthy. Government-NGO partnership was a hallmark of Bangladesh’s development scene. Coordinated activities took place in areas such as agriculture and rural development, physical infrastructure, healthcare and family planning, primary and secondary schooling and environmental protection. 23. Bangladesh noted there were many discriminations and oppressive practices embedded in its age-old social systems and customs. Many of these stemmed from poverty and the absence of real development. Resolving them might and would require time. However, they would be addressed. Bangladesh had embarked on a path of inclusion by striving to guarantee people’s rights to food, knowledge, security and vote as well as to end all oppression. B.

Slovenia remained deeply concerned about reports of abuse and sexual molestation of girls and inaccessibility to school. It asked Bangladesh about the intended concrete steps to respond to the reports of CRC, CEDAW, UNICEF and others and to implement their recommendations on the issue of discrimination. 83. The Minister responded to the questions raised and comments made.

She referred to the police reform project supported by UNDP and other bilateral development partners, under which gender sensitisation training programmes were held. She also referred to human rights training provided by bilateral development partners to some special law enforcing forces, including the Rapid Action Battalion.

He noted that in order to generate the capabilities of the poor, education has been highly emphasized whereby the education sector had received high boost. 90. The Minister acknowledged that Bangladesh had immensely benefited from the dialogue as it offered an opportunity to exchange views on human rights situation in Bangladesh. Bangladesh took pride in the fact that many of its initiatives and ideas such as micro-credit and non-formal education were seen globally as examples of “best practices”, while it remained keenly aware of its shortcomings.  91. The Minister noted that poverty eradication and ensuring basic livelihood, therefore, remained at the core of its development initiatives. She also noted that Bangladesh suffered from the perils of climate change for no fault of its own. All these impediments are seriously affecting socio-economic development of the Bangladeshi people, which would, in turn, have a negative impact on the full enjoyment of human rights. 92. The Minister expressed hope for a better understanding of the need to address the development concerns faced by Bangladesh and for support of the international community in this regard. She emphasized that achieving the MDGs was one of the necessary pre.conditions for fuller enjoyment of the rights of Bangladeshi citizens.  93. The Minister announced that Bangladesh would give due consideration to all the recommendations that are consistent with the expectations of the Bangladeshi people. II.
