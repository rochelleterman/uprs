The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth session from 21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Romania was held at the 3rd meeting on 22 January 2013. The delegation of Romania was headed by the Secretary of State, Bogdan Aurescu. At its 10th meeting, held on 25 January 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Romania. 2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Romania: Czech Republic, Kenya and Qatar. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Romania:  (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/ROU/1);  (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/ROU/2);  (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/ROU/3). 4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Romania through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR).  I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process  A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The head of the delegation presented the national report and highlighted several measures undertaken and achievements made by Romania in the implementation of recommendations put forward during the 2008 universal periodic review. The delegation stated that the national report, which had been prepared based on a broad consultation with various State agencies, the national human rights institution and civil society representatives, provided comprehensive information on main measures taken to implement each of the accepted recommendations of the 2008 review. 6. The delegation stated that the legal system concerning the protection of human rights was complex and encompassed several institutions that complemented each other without overlapping. Thus, the Romanian Institute for Human Rights, the National Council for Combating Discrimination and the Ombudsman had complementary competences that included preventing all forms of discrimination; mediating cases of discrimination; investigating and sanctioning discrimination cases; organizing public opinion polls on various aspects regarding human rights protection; receiving complaints filed by individuals who have been aggrieved by public administration authorities through violations of their civic rights and freedoms and taking decisions on such complaints; providing victims of discrimination with specialized assistance; and notifying the Constitutional Court on the unconstitutionally of laws before their promulgation. 7. The delegation highlighted the importance for Romania of the protection of the culture and identity of persons belonging to national minorities, and indicated that Romania had ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Those two international instruments, along with the domestic legislative framework, represented important guarantees for an efficient protection of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities. 8. The delegation stated that in the framework of the antidiscrimination policies, the situation of the Roma minority remained of special concern. Romania had adopted a package of legal instruments in order to provide the authorities with the necessary instruments to efficiently combat discrimination against the Roma and protect vulnerable groups. The National Council for Combating Discrimination and the Ombudsman were the main institutions that contributed to effective enforcement of the anti-discrimination legislation and to the legal protection of the Roma population. 9. The delegation stated that as the necessity of a coherent approach towards improving the social integration of Roma had been acknowledged by Romania since 2000, policies and programmes had been carried out by the Government in the past decade in the framework of the national strategy for 2001-2011, which had envisaged measures in the areas of education, social protection and employment, culture, combating discrimination and promoting access to information and intercultural and inter-ethnic dialogue. Romania had adopted a new strategy for the inclusion of Romanian citizens belonging to the Roma minority for the period of 2012-2020, which was a multidimensional and comprehensive document aimed at joining the efforts of the central and local authorities, the Roma community and civil society and at continuing to address the social inclusion of Roma. The new Roma strategy focused on six areas: education, employment, health, housing and small infrastructure, culture, and social infrastructure. 10. The Romanian system of promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities allowed the Roma minority to be politically represented and to participate in the decision-making process at all levels, central and local. Following the previous local elections of June 2012 and the parliamentary elections of December 2012, the Roma community was being represented in the Parliament by three members: two deputies and one senator, and at the local level by one Roma mayor and 161 members of local councils. 11. To address the drop-out rate in schools, the authorities had combined measures aimed at stimulating school attendance with those measures that were intended to identify children at risk of dropping out or who do not attend school, and to prevent such cases. The institution of the school mediators had been proven to be a useful instrument to monitor the situation and to prevent drop-out cases as well as deal with the school attendance of Roma pupils. There were currently 923 trained school mediators, of whom 437 were employed in the county school inspectorates, local authorities and county councils. 12. Regarding the administration of justice, major progress had been achieved in reforming and finalizing the legislative framework and putting in place and consolidating the relevant institutions, as well as implementing the newly adopted measures. Law No. 202/2010 (Small Reform Law) had already introduced a series of measures to simplify and render more efficient judicial procedures, including the length of proceedings, and thus anticipating the entry into force of the new procedural codes. An unprecedented legislative reform consisted of four new codes adopted by the Parliament in 2009 and 2010, aimed at simplifying and making the judicial practice more efficient. The new Civil Code had entered into force on 1 October 2011. The entry into force of the other three codes would follow in 2013 and 2014. 13. As to the strengthening of the accountability of magistrates, a new law on the matter had entered into force in January 2012. The law amended the scheme of disciplinary offences, increased sanctions, and strengthened the independence and the operational capacity of the Judicial Inspection of the Superior Council of Magistracy. Measures had also been taken for improving the transparency and objectivity of the procedure for the promotion of judges to the High Court of Cassation and Justice. Thus, the relevant law was already in force following its adoption by the Parliament in December 2011. 14. The delegation highlighted that Romania was the first European country to create a National Integrity Agency (NIA), which had been operational since 2007. The Agency was an independent, operational institution, competent to control and verify declared assets of public officials and cases of conflict of interest. Effective institutions were in place to prevent and combat high-level corruption; some of those were novelties at the European level or had achieved such significant results that they had become best practices for other countries (for example, NIA and the National Anti-corruption Directorate). 15. The National Anti-corruption Directorate had consistent and positive results, functioning as a specialized and independent structure competent to investigate high-level corruption cases. During the previous five years, over 90 per cent of its indictments had led to convictions and 90 per cent of investigations had been finalized in under 1.5 years. That activity continued to include significant numbers of senior politicians and officials. Regarding the prevention of and fight against local-level corruption and corruption in vulnerable areas, the National Anti-corruption Strategy, its corresponding action plan and the inventory of preventive measures had been approved by the Government in March 2012. The new Government assumed the Strategy in May 2012 and in June the Parliament unanimously endorsed the Strategy through a political declaration; implementation was ongoing. 16. The delegation highlighted the major role of media in promoting a culture of tolerance and mutual understanding. From this perspective, media awareness-raising programmes, such as ÒColourful, but colour-blindÓ, ÒDosta, overcome prejudices, learn to know Roma peopleÓ, and ÒVoices of the Roma community in societyÓ had increased awareness on that matter. 17. Regarding the situation of sexual minorities, the delegation reported that the legislation provided for punishment for any form of discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation. The main form of public expression of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community was the GayFest, organized annually in March. Due to the involvement of the public authorities that ensured the public order and close cooperation with the non-governmental organization ACCEPT, which was the main promoter of LGBT rights in Romania, the number of incidents during the event had significantly reduced to the extent that in the past two years, the event had taken place without any incident. 18. The delegation stated that Romania had constantly developed policies and implemented specific measures aimed at improving every citizenÕs health and access to health care, especially for vulnerable groups. Although there was no strategy implemented at the moment in the field of sexual and reproductive health, the Ministry of Health had adopted targeted measures that had led to a gradual decrease in the abortion mortality rate. 19. On the issue of the rights of the child, the delegation stated that the top objectives of the 2008Ð2013 national strategy on children rightsÕ protection and its plan of action was to guarantee the improvement of the situation of children in a special protection system, further develop community services and ensure equal treatment for all children. 20. With regard to combating human trafficking, the National Strategy against Trafficking in Persons for 2012Ð2016 set up the framework of action for combating the phenomenon. The current National Strategy put forward a number of concrete measures aimed at preventing trafficking in human beings. Increasing the level of understanding of the dimensions, forms and implications of trafficking in human beings was essential for any successful prevention. In that respect, the mass media could play an important role in supporting and promoting clear-cut public information messages regarding the phenomenon. Organizing workshops for media representatives on the specificities of trafficking in human beings, including children, ensured the adequate promotion by the mass media of the anti-trafficking messages, the promotion of an accurate and complete perspective of such crime and the eradication of stereotypes regarding the victim profile and the forms of exploitation. 21. Regarding the protection of child victims of trafficking, the 2011 legislation established complementary detailed procedures with respect to identification and referral. Also, as a supplementary measure to ensure victimsÕ access to specialized assistance, regardless of their participation in the criminal proceedings, a clear definition of the term Òvictim of traffickingÓ had been introduced in 2010. 22. For victims willing to participate in the criminal trial, the National Agency against Trafficking in Human Beings initiated, in 2008, the Victim Coordination during Criminal Proceedings progamme. Its objective is different from that of the social assistance for rehabilitation and reintegration. In 2012, the victim coordination programme was further developed by including new partners: the General Inspectorate for Immigration and the Probation Directorate of the Ministry of Justice. 23. With respect to the cooperation of Romania with United Nations human rights mechanisms, the delegation highlighted the countryÕs commitment to address its backlog of reporting to the treaty bodies. In that respect, Romania had submitted a common core document as well as reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Romania had hosted three visits of special rapporteurs and agreed in principle to the visit of the Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice. Romania had also ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT) and would step up its efforts in view of a possible ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CPED) and the Optional Protocol to CRPD (OP-CRPD). The delegation confirmed the commitment of Romania to the protection and promotion of human rights.  B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 24.

Romania noted that, consequently, the domestic courts gave direct effect to, for example, the European Convention on Human Rights and the case law of the European Court. 101. On the question regarding results obtained in combating corruption, Romania reiterated particularly that effective institutions had been put in place to combat corruption. It noted that in 2012, Romania was ranked 66th in the corruption perception index issued by Transparency International, compared to 75th in 2011. 102.

On the remarks made regarding secret detention centres and illegal transfers of persons, the delegation stated that Romania had approached this issue in a spirit of profound attachment to the rule of law and promotion and protection of human rights.
