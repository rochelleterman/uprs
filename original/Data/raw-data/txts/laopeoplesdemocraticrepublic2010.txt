Presentation by the State under review 5. At the 4th meeting, on 4 May 2010, the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs introduced the national report, prepared with the participation of civil society, the media, academia and other stakeholders. He emphasized that the engagement of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic in the review process was part of its efforts to promote and protect human rights. He stated that the Lao multi-ethnic people had long suffered from colonialism and foreign aggression and had been liberated only after the establishment of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic in 1975. Since that time, fundamental human rights had been gradually restored and protected and were now guaranteed by the Constitution to all Lao citizens. 6. In order to ensure the prosperity and well-being of the Lao people, the Government had embarked on socio-economic development strategies and had recorded achievements such as an economic growth rate averaging 7 per cent annually; a per capita income of more than $900 in 2009, compared with less than $200 in the 1970s; and a reduction in poverty from 49 per cent in 1990 to about 25 per cent in 2009.  The school enrolment rate had exceeded 90 per cent, and the literacy rate of people older than 15 was now almost 80 per cent.  The infant and maternal mortality rates had considerably decreased, and life expectancy had risen to more than 60 years. 7. The Government had made great efforts to promote human rights and had adopted a Legal Sector Master Plan envisioning a State ruled by law by 2020. A reform of the governance sector was considered a top priority so as to ensure a transparent, accountable and participatory system. In that context, judicial independence had been strengthened and capacity-building had been undertaken for judges, prosecutors, lawyers and police officers.  8. The Government had also adopted laws on the development and protection of women and a Law on the protection of the rights and interests of children. As a result, gender equality and the advancement of women had been enhanced.  9. With regard to international cooperation, it was noted that Laos had already acceded to six core human rights treaties and two optional protocols, and was a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and a signatory to the Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Laos had also played an active role in the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights.  The recent visit by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief was another sign of the Government’s sincerity in working with the international community  10. With regard to torture, Laos confirmed that acts of torture and maltreatment were considered criminal offences and that the Criminal Procedure Law did not allow the inhumane treatment of detainees in any circumstances. The Government had undertaken measures to improve prison conditions and had conducted training for prison officers and related personnel on the United Nations minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners. Furthermore, Laos would consider signing the Convention against Torture. 11. As regards the death penalty, it was emphasized that that sentence was intended to deter the most extreme and serious crimes, particularly drug trafficking. Although the death penalty was still in existence legally, no execution had ever taken place. Laos had upheld a moratorium for many years and would consider revising the Penal Law in the coming years, including with a view to limiting the scope of crimes to which the death penalty would apply. 12. It was emphasized that the Lao People’s Democratic Republic consisted of 49 ethnic groups living together in peace and harmony.  The Constitution and national legislation and policies encouraged solidarity among all ethnic groups and condemned ethnic discrimination, including against Lao Hmong. Those Lao Hmong who had been illegal migrants in Thailand had been welcomed back and had resettled in designated development areas, and they enjoyed all rights guaranteed by the Constitution, without discrimination. These included the right to freedom of movement within the country and to leave and return to their home country.   13. While referring to significant progress and achievements in advancing human rights, Laos was aware of challenges that needed to be addressed, including with regard to public awareness concerning national laws and regulations, especially among persons living in mountainous and remote areas, and in relation to the effective enforcement of the law. 14. The Government would thus continue its efforts to achieve the country’s poverty alleviation goals and, through continued reform of the public administration and legal system, to further strengthen its capacity to effectively implement domestic laws.  B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 15. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements.

Turkey also inquired whether Laos envisaged adopting a plan to combat human trafficking and requested information about measures taken to reduce maternal and infant mortality.   25. Indonesia commended the efforts of Laos to enhance good governance and its fight against poverty, highlighting the adverse effects of regional wars. It noted the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the emphasis placed on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, as well as efforts to reform the judiciary and prison management.

The Netherlands also referred to reported attempts by local officials to force Christians to recant their faith.    36. Slovenia noted that the two mandate holders who had visited Laos had expressed appreciation for the cooperation and assistance extended to them.

Slovenia inquired about measures intended to implement the Special Rapporteur’s recommendations.  37. Sri Lanka expressed appreciation for achievements in terms of poverty alleviation, the right to work, education and health, as well as the efforts of Laos to graduate from its least developed status by 2020.

In 2004, the National Assembly had adopted the Law on the Development and Protection of Women, and in 2006 it had adopted the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interest of Children. The country had also acceded to various international conventions, such as CEDAW and CRC and its two Optional Protocols.  43. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic had developed appropriate national mechanisms to promote and protect the rights of women and children, such as the National Commission for the Advancement of Women and the National Commission for Mothers and Children, and it had developed a number of national strategies and plans on the issue. In addition, the Lao Women’s Union had established information and counselling services in various  provinces and districts.  Gender equality had been mainstreamed into the five-year social and economic development plans. The Government would continue to implement strategies and programmes to enhance access to education and health services for women and girls, in particular in rural areas, including through Government-funded ethnic boarding schools in most provinces. 44. With regard to health services, it was noted that a programme of immunization had been conducted throughout the country and that the Government would continue to provide medical services and first-aid kits for all villages. 45. Concerning gender equality, attention was drawn to the fact that women now accounted for a quarter of the deputies in the National Assembly. An increasing number of women also held high-ranking positions in the Government, including the Vice-President of the National Assembly, two ministers and seven vice-ministers. At the local level, many women acted as provincial vice-governors, district chiefs or heads of provincial or district departments or offices, or as village heads. The school enrolment rates for girls and women were also increasing.  46. As for child labour, Laos had ratified and implemented the ILO Convention on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour. With regard to human trafficking, the country had adopted laws to combat trafficking and had also set up a National Steering Committee for that purpose. It was a party to the Palermo Convention and its relevant protocols, and it cooperated with countries in the region as well as with international organizations. Law enforcement agencies had been strengthened, and a number of perpetrators had been prosecuted. 47. On questions relating to the judiciary, Laos noted that its Constitution clearly defined the role, function and authority of the People’s Court and the Public Prosecutors, which were separate from the executive branch of the Government. High-ranking officials of the People’s Court and the Public Prosecutors were appointed by the National Assembly and reported to it.   48. Since the promulgation of the Constitution in 1991, Laos had progressively worked to develop the rule of law and promote the independence of the courts and public prosecutors. A law on the operation and functioning of the People’s Court and a law on public prosecutors had been adopted by the National Assembly in 2003, and a separate budget had been allocated for their operation and development. 49. The People’s Court and the public prosecutor were working independently, and any interference in their work was prohibited.  In addition, a law on the handling of petitions had been adopted in 2006. The law provided for the right to file individual complaints, requests and petitions regarding the violation of rights with various authorities concerned, including Government authorities, the People’s Court, the public prosecutor and the National Assembly. 50. With regard to questions concerning ethnic groups and the Hmong issue, it was noted that Laos was a nation with 49 ethnic groups that lived together in peace and harmony.  The Government pursued an unswerving policy of enhancing the solidarity and equality among the Lao multi-ethnic people. Equality for all ethnic groups was provided for in the Constitution, and the State pursued a policy of promoting unity and equality among all ethnic groups; ensuring for all groups the right to protect, preserve and promote their customs and cultures. Acts of segregation or discrimination aimed at ethnic groups were prohibited; the State implemented every measure to gradually develop and upgrade the socio-economic development levels of all ethnic groups. The Government had paid great attention to alleviating poverty with regard to each ethnic group in order to gradually improve their living conditions.  51. Laos noted that the Hmong were one of the ethnic groups that stood side by side with other such groups in the struggle for national liberation and in carrying out the strategic tasks of safeguarding and constructing the country. Although the Hmong represented less than 7 per cent of the population, their representation in the party was 12 per cent; in the Government, more than 10 per cent; in the National Assembly, 8 per cent; and among newly graduated students at primary and secondary schools and university, more than 12 per cent. 52. Regarding concerns over the repatriation of Hmong from Thailand, it was noted that more than 7,000 Lao Hmong who had illegally migrated to Thailand for economic reasons had been safely welcomed back in accordance with the bilateral agreement between the Governments of Laos and Thailand. A great number of them had voluntarily returned to their original home towns, with the assistance of the Government.  For those who did not wish to return to their original home towns or villages, but rather to move to the new Government-sponsored development villages arranged for returnees, the Government had responded accordingly and continued to provide assistance.  53. Those who had once considered migrating to a third country had now changed their minds and decided to resettle in their mother land, since they had met their loved ones and relatives after having been apart for three years, and had been treated fairly by the Government. The Government maintained its consistent position of welcoming goodwill visits to their sites by representatives of diplomatic missions and international organizations.  54. With regard to the 158 Hmong recognized as “persons of concern” under the mandate of UNHCR, it was noted that they should no longer be seen as persons of concern, since the  repatriated Hmong were now living safely in their homeland without fear and were being assisted by their own Government. The returnees were full citizens of Laos and could travel inside the country and abroad, like other Lao citizens.  55. With regard to freedom of religion, Laos confirmed that it was guaranteed under the Constitution and that all citizens were free to believe or not to believe in any religion. All acts creating division or constituting discrimination against religions and creating social disorder were prohibited. In addition, laws and regulations such as Prime Minister Decree No. 92-PM, on the Management and Protection of Religious Activities in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, also provided for religious freedom. 56. Over the previous two decades, the establishment of hundreds of new evangelist and other churches had been authorized and tens of thousands of persons had been converted. If any social problem had arisen from this, it had been caused by a local dispute between those who respected traditional rituals and those who had adopted new rituals. In some instances, the local authorities had had to intervene to appease the dispute, but no one had ever been arrested on grounds of faith or religious conviction. 57. Although remaining a minority, Christians were growing in number, while the number of Buddhists was decreasing. According to a 2005 census, Buddhists made up 67 per cent of the population and Christians 1.5 per cent, with approximately 41,746 Catholic and 60,700 Protestant believers. There were 95 Catholic and 225 Protestant churches. 58. The Lao Government was considering implementing the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief during her visit to the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. 59. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya asked about methods used to deal with unexploded munitions, which were an obstacle to social and economic development, claimed the lives of innocent people and caused disabilities. It also asked Laos about its plans to empower its people through education, including higher education, and made a number of recommendations. 60. Italy commended Laos for the de facto moratorium on the death penalty. It also welcomed progress in the area of religious freedom, as recently confirmed by the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion following her 2009 visit. Italy noted, however, that restrictions on religious minorities, especially Christians, were still being reported. It made a number of recommendations. 61. Mozambique noted programmes for public health and the development of the rule of law. It encouraged the Government to accelerate the implementation of those programmes. It asked Laos to share its experiences in implementing the National Strategy for the Advancement of Women (2006-2010) and to pay special attention to the prevention, suppression and punishment of the trafficking in persons, especially women and children.  62. Tajikistan welcomed the intention of Laos to pursue a consistent human rights policy. It noted efforts to improve and enhance the democratic system so that State mechanisms truly served the nation and the people. It also noted that Laos had acceded to six core human rights conventions and two optional protocols, as well as other relevant instruments. 63. Finland commended Laos for having ratified core human rights treaties, including ICCPR and the Convention on Persons with Disabilities, and asked what measures were envisaged for their implementation. While recognizing efforts made to promote women’s rights, it inquired about measures to combat violence against women, including awareness-raising programmes.  64. Switzerland welcomed the ratification of ICCPR as well as cooperation with special procedures, in particular with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. Switzerland expressed concern about the treatment of the Hmong and the confiscation of lands without adequate compensation. It also expressed concern about the conditions of detention. 65. Kyrgyzstan noted that Lao was a multi-ethnic country, constantly implementing policies to guarantee human rights and reduce poverty. The Government acknowledged that much remained to be done. Kyrgyzstan noted that Laos had taken measures to expand access to health-care services and to improve its legal and judicial system through the adoption of more than 90 laws.  66. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted positive developments and achievements in areas such as poverty eradication, the right to work, education and health, the rights of women and children, the right to life, the right to participate in public affairs, cultural rights and the right to information. It also noted that, as a multi-ethnic nation, Laos was pursuing a policy of ensuring unity and equality among all ethnic groups and of protecting their rights, customs and cultures. 67. Nepal noted achievements in terms of maintaining political stability and social harmony in a multi-ethnic society. Nepal welcomed the adherence of Laos to the rule of law, characterized by the separation of powers. It noted the country’s commitment to promoting human rights and its compliance with international human rights instruments, as well as its willingness to cooperate with special procedures and other human rights mechanisms.  68. Egypt welcomed the establishment of inter-agency mechanisms to promote human rights. It welcomed the implementation of the national strategy for the advancement of women (2006-2010) and the adoption and implementation of policies and strategies relating to the rights of children, which had increased the amount of attention accorded to the protection of children from abuse, child labour, sexual exploitation and trafficking.  69. The United Kingdom noted with satisfaction that Laos was considering signing the Convention against Torture and acceding to other human rights conventions. It asked what time frame was being considered for their ratification. It expressed concern at the repatriation of more than 4,000 Hmong from Thailand and asked Laos to ensure that international humanitarian organizations, including UNHCR, and the diplomatic community were allowed access.  70. Mexico highlighted the ratification by Laos of most of the core human rights treaties and expressed the hope that the Convention against Torture and the Convention against Enforced Disappearance would soon be ratified. Mexico recognized efforts to eradicate poverty and improve health services and asked for further information about measures to create an adequate environment for civil society and women’s groups, as recommended by CEDAW. 71. Canada expressed concern at reported restrictions on freedom of speech and on the Hmong repatriated from Thailand to Laos in 2009. It applauded the leadership shown by Laos on the issue of cluster munitions and the planned hosting of the first meeting of States parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions. It also applauded the adoption of the decree on the registration of domestic associations, which would allow for the development of civil society. 72. Malaysia commended Laos for its commitment to socio-economic development, demonstrated through its investment in poverty eradication, economic growth and human resource development. It considered that its focus in critical areas such as education, health and gender equality would have a positive impact on human rights, and it made a number of recommendations.  73. Armenia noted the cooperation of Laos with United Nations institutions, including human rights treaty bodies and special procedures, such as the Special Rapporteur on Freedom and Belief. In that regard, Armenia observed with satisfaction statements in the national report indicating that Laos was considering issuing invitations to other special rapporteurs. 74. The Philippines noted the establishment of inter-agency mechanisms devoted to the implementation of human rights treaties, which demonstrated the commitment of the Government to comply with its human rights obligations. It commended the establishment of a National Human Rights Research Centre.

It also commended Lao for having achieved a decrease in maternal and child mortality rates. It made a recommendation. 76. Hungary recalled that the fate of Hmong individuals reported to have returned voluntarily to Laos continued to be a source of concern for the international community, as highlighted by the Secretary-General in December 2009. Hungary further noted that the situation of women in rural and remote areas should be accorded special attention, including through their involvement in the design and implementation of local development plans. 77. Lebanon welcomed the efforts made by the Government to increase the protection of human rights and praised its economic development strategy, which would contribute to the improvement of the socio-economic conditions of vulnerable groups. Lebanon also commended Laos for the ratification of a number of international human rights conventions. 78. Belgium acknowledged that Laos had had a difficult historical background.

Article 44 of the Constitution stipulated that Lao citizens enjoyed freedom of speech, the press and assembly, and had the right to establish associations and to stage demonstrations that were not contrary to the law. A Law on Media, a Law on Trade Unions and a Decree on Associations had recently been adopted. The Lao Government recognized that media played a crucial role in promoting and protecting human rights and that the violation of those freedoms was a criminal offence. 88. The Lao Government was strongly committed to ensuring that all laws governing the freedoms of expression, assembly and association were implemented effectively in practice. Indeed, remarkable progress and achievements had been accomplished in that area. 89. To date, private print, radio and television media had significantly increased. High-speed Internet access at low cost was available in most major towns and even in rural areas, without any restriction. Thus far, the Government had never taken any measures to interfere with any radio or television broadcasting, including international cable channels, or to block Internet sites. 90. Lao media were free to report on views and opinions expressed by the people on any issue. Despite progress made over the years in implementing the Constitution and other laws pertaining to the freedoms of expression and the press, a number of challenges still needed to be addressed. Print media and radio and television broadcasts still did not reach all areas of the country. To further address that concern, the Government had invested in the media network, including digital broadcasting. 91. With regard to law enforcement, it was noted that the police force of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic worked according to a well-established system that took into account respect for humanitarian principles. Complaints about violations could be addressed directly to the relevant authority, such as the National Assembly. The authorities concerned were also working to improve detention and re-education centres. In that connection, the Ministry of Public Security was working on a draft instruction of the Minister on the Management of Detention and Re-education Centres with a view to addressing relevant concerns. 92. With regard to a request by ICRC to visit detention centres, it was noted that such a request should be submitted in written form through diplomatic channels for consideration. Over the previous 10 years, a number of foreign delegations and representatives of international organizations had been permitted to visit detention and re-education centres. 93. With regard to preparations to host the first meeting of States parties to the Convention on cluster munitions, Laos highlighted that it was the country most affected by cluster munitions, given that some 3 million tons of bombs had been dropped on Lao soil, killing and victimizing more than 50,000 people.  More than a third of the country’s territory was still contaminated by such unexploded ordnance. Even more than 30 years after the war, some 300 people were still victimized by unexploded ordnance every year, which deprived the Lao people of fundamental human rights, including the right to life and development. 94. In order to address that challenge, the Government had adopted a national strategy and an action plan, incorporated into the national socio-economic development plan so that the issue could be addressed in a development context. At the international level, Laos was working closely with all countries to put an end to cluster munitions and promote the Convention.  95. In conclusion, Laos expressed its appreciation to all delegates for their active participation and their contributions to its review. While having accomplished significant achievements in the promotion and protection of human rights, Laos was aware of remaining shortcomings and challenges. Laos was keen to engage in discussions, exchanges and cooperation with the international community on the basis of equality, trust and mutual respect, in order to further strengthen its people’s enjoyment of human rights. In that context, the universal periodic review mechanism would facilitate the sharing of experience and promote understanding of human rights based on historical, cultural and social diversity.  Finally, the Lao delegation thanked the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the troika and coordinator, and others who had contributed to the success of this engagement.  Ireland, the Republic of Korea, Australia, Azerbaijan, the United States of America, Latvia, Poland, Nicaragua, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Iraq, Nigeria. II.
