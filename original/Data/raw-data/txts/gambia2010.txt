The review of the Gambia was held at the 6th meeting, on 10 February 2010. The Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Marie Saine-Firdaus, headed the delegation of the Gambia. At its 9th meeting, held on 12 February 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on the Gambia. 2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Gambia: Cameroon, Jordan and Ukraine. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were issued for the review of the Gambia: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/GMB/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/GMB/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/GMB/3).  4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Gambia through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. In preparing the national report, a broad-based national task force composed of all Government institutions and civil society organizations addressing the issue of human rights was established. In addition, the draft report was discussed and approved by the Cabinet before being submitted to the Working Group. This broad-based consultative process will also be used in the follow-up process of the review. 6. The 1997 Constitution devoted an entire chapter to fundamental rights and freedoms and, for the first time in the history of the Gambia, it guaranteed civil and political rights as well as socio-economic and cultural rights. It also provides for the separation of powers, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. In that regard, the constitutional head of the judiciary is the Chief Justice, appointed by the President after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission. Judges are also appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Commission. In the exercise of their functions, they are subject only to the Constitution and other laws of the Gambia. Moreover, security of tenure is guaranteed, because a judge can be removed by the President only in consultation with the Commission. 7. The right to life, for which no derogation is permitted, is guaranteed even during times of public emergency. The death penalty, an exceptional punishment intended only for the most serious crimes, is applicable but is limited to murder and treasonable offences resulting in death. Furthermore, Gambian law prescribes that procedural guarantees, including the right to a fair hearing by an independent tribunal, the presumption of innocence, the right to defence and the right to review by a higher tribunal, must be observed before the death penalty can be imposed and carried out. In addition, the right to seek presidential pardon or commutation of sentence is guaranteed under the Constitution. Since the reintroduction of the death penalty in 1995, many accused persons have been convicted and sentenced to death, but no executions have taken place. Instead, all of those persons are serving life sentences.  8. Freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment is guaranteed under the Constitution. This provision is also non-derogable in situations of public emergency. However, there is as yet no specific legislation criminalizing torture. The perpetrators of such violations are prosecuted under the criminal code for such offences as threatening violence, common assault and assault causing bodily harm. In addition, victims can petition the High Court for compensation. Similarly, protection from unlawful arrest and detention is provided for in the Constitution, and persons who fall victim to such arrest and detention are entitled to petition the Court for redress and compensation.  9. The Gambian Constitution also guarantees every person “the right to freedom of speech and expression, which shall include freedom of the press and other media”. However, those rights are not absolute; they are to be exercised subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and to other laws of the Gambia promulgated in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of the country, including national security, public order, decency and morality. 10. In an illustration of the Government’s commitment to creating an environment that ensures free operation of the media and a free flow of information, as provided for in the Constitution, the Information Act of 2009 was adopted to provide for the restructuring, development and regulation of the information and communications sectors. 11. Media practitioners are therefore protected under the Constitution, subject to reasonable restrictions. For the past 15 years, the growth of privately owned print, radio and electronic media has been unprecedented. However, most practitioners have not had basic training in media reporting and hence do not carry out their functions responsibly. 12. In the case of Chief Ebrima Manneh, the Government has investigated his whereabouts, but to no avail. In 2009, the Attorney General and Minister of Justice conducted an unannounced visit to prisons and detention centres of the National Intelligence Agency, together with the leader of the leading opposition party (UDP) and the Minority Leader of the National Assembly, to search for missing persons such as Kanyiba Kanyi and Chief Ebrima Manneh, but they were not found in these institutions. In addition, the case of Deyda Hydara is still being investigated, but there are challenges because the two key witnesses are outside the jurisdiction and several attempts to reach them have been unsuccessful. 13. Over the years, the Gambia has established the Office of the Ombudsman, the National Council for Civic Education, the National Women’s Bureau and Council, the Independent Electoral Commission, the National Assembly and an independent judiciary. 14. The Ombudsman is empowered to investigate allegations of maladministration, mismanagement or discriminatory practices in any public body. The Gambia is in the process of reviewing the mandate of the Ombudsman to see if it can be expanded to address broader human rights issues in accordance with the Paris Principles. 15. The National Women’s Council advises the Government on policies and plans aimed at promoting women’s rights and works closely with the Ministry of Women Affairs. The 10-year National Women Policy (1999-2009) has just expired, and the Government is working on a new policy. The Women’s Bill will be considered for enactment at the next session of the National Assembly, in March 2010. In addition, a bill on gender-based violence, including protection against the commercial sexual exploitation of women, will soon be drafted. 16. The Government, with the collaboration of civil society, has embarked on an awareness-raising campaign aimed at discouraging female genital mutilation, and it is also providing alternative livelihood skills and assistance to circumcisers. A national coordinating committee and a coalition of non-governmental organizations have been established to address this issue. It requires huge financial and material resources which have posed a great challenge to Gambia. 17. The trafficking in women is addressed in the Trafficking in Persons Act of 2007, which seeks to prevent, suppress and punish those engaged in the trafficking in persons and to rehabilitate and reintegrate victims of trafficking. The National Action Plan is the blueprint for the effective implementation of the Act. Furthermore, the Government has provided resources for the establishment of an agency on the trafficking in persons, and the office will be operational by April 2010.  18. The 2005 Children’s Act prohibits child marriage. In addition, the Government uses community child protection committees to educate communities about this issue and encourage them to abandon harmful practices such as early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. The Government has successfully intervened in several cases of early and forced marriage.  19. The Independent Electoral Commission is responsible for the conduct and supervision of the registration of voters for all public elections and the conduct and supervision of all public elections and referendums. It also ensures that candidates make a full declaration of their assets at the time of nomination and that they have equal access to the media and equal opportunity to campaign throughout the country. 20. With respect to the education of children, concrete steps have been taken to ensure that all schools are accessible to students within a radius of 3 km. The school system, including lower basic schools, upper basic schools and senior secondary schools, has increased fourfold over the past 14 years. The Government has invested much in the health sector. Policies and programmes have led to, inter alia, an increase in the number of State hospitals, satisfactory access to reproductive health services, a significant drop in HIV 1 prevalence and a decline in the infant mortality rate. 21. The Gambia is committed to considering requests from the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. 22. The lack of adequate human, financial and material resources, training and infrastructure has had a negative impact on the Gambia’s ability to effectively promote and protect human rights, as well as meet its reporting obligations under various human rights treaties. Institutions such as the police, prisons, the judiciary, the justice department and the education and health sectors are in need of technical and financial assistance. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 23. During the interactive dialogue, 55 delegations made statements.  24. Senegal noted that the Gambia was party to several international human rights instruments, demonstrating its commitment to human rights, and also noted that the country hosted the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Citing constitutional provisions and various initiatives on the rights of persons with disabilities, Senegal asked when the Gambia would ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It called upon the Human Rights Council to support the Gambia in facing the challenges it had identified. 25. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela underlined the Gambia’s efforts relating to the rights of women, including its accession to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, whose principles, such as the right to equal treatment and opportunities in all areas of national life, were recognized in the Constitution. Venezuela underlined the presence of women in positions of high responsibility and the establishment of the Ministry for Women Affairs, the Women’s Bureau and the National Women’s Council. All those efforts had been made despite the economic situation. Venezuela made a recommendation. 26. The Sudan noted that the Gambia’s ratification or accession to various international and regional treaties reflected its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights.

Hungary made a recommendation. 36. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted that, while the Gambia lacked a national human rights commission, the Ombudsman was constitutionally empowered to investigate allegations of maladministration, mismanagement or discriminatory practices in Government departments and public bodies, as well as complaints of injustice, corruption, abuse of power and unfair treatment by a public officer in the exercise of official duties. Iran made recommendations. 37. Egypt acknowledged the Gambian commitment to reducing poverty, providing free and compulsory education and ensuring access to health services, despite a lack of adequate resources.

Equal access was provided to the media and to political candidates. 63. With regard to homosexuality and sexual orientation in general, Gambia emphasised that the President had never said that homosexuals should be killed. The Gambia had cultural values, norms and practices that were different from those of other countries, and it did not recognize sexual orientation as a universal human right. The law punishes sexual activity between persons of the same sex. 64. The Gambia stated that the arrest of Femi Peters had been neither a result of his political activity nor a violation of freedom of assembly, but had resulted from his violation of the Public Order Act.   65. Kyrgyzstan welcomed the Gambia’s efforts to strengthen its national human rights protection system.

Sweden made recommendations. 70. The Netherlands welcomed the fact that Gambia was party to most core human rights instruments and asked for further information about witchcraft and the independence of judges.
