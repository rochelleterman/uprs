The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth session from 3 to 14 October 2011. The review of Uganda was held at the 14th meeting on 11 October 2011. The delegation of Uganda was headed by Oryem Henry Okello, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in charge of International Cooperation. At its 18th meeting held on 14 October 2011, the Working Group adopted the report on Uganda. 2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Uganda: Nigeria, Maldives and Uruguay. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were issued for the review of Uganda:  (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/UGA/1);   (b) A compilation prepared by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/UGA/2);  (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/UGA/3).  4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Uganda through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process  A. Presentation by the State under review 5. Uganda fully appreciated the opportunity and spirit of constructive dialogue created by the UPR process. The delegation pledged the State.s unwavering commitment to the process, through which it could take stock of its own progress, identify challenges and map the way forward.  6. The delegation reported on a nationwide consultative process that had involved multisectoral stakeholders drawn from the public and private sectors, as well as members of civil society organizations. 7. The delegation reaffirmed the commitment of Uganda to the promotion and protection of human rights. Uganda was party to most of the major international human rights instruments and had in place legal, legislative and institutional frameworks in the area of human rights. The delegation wished to highlight those rights pertaining to the most vulnerable of the society: women, youth, children, the elderly and minorities. As the Constitution singled out those rights, the Government had deliberately endeavoured to concretize them, despite the challenges that Uganda faced.  8. Uganda had a legal framework of affirmative action in favour of women. In 1994, Uganda had had a woman Vice President. Currently, the position of Speaker of Parliament was held by a woman. There were currently 2 women Justices of the Supreme Court, 3 in the Constitutional Court / Court of Appeal, one of whom was also the Deputy Chief Justice, and 13 female Judges of the High Court. Uganda had a woman at the rank of Brigadier in the army.  9. Article 78 of the Constitution of Uganda stipulated that at least one woman from each district must be elected to Parliament. Women had also been encouraged to run for other Parliamentary seats against men. 10. The Children Act contained the broad spectrum of rights for children. It established the National Council for Children to advise Government and promote policy and programmes regarding the development and protection of children in Uganda. Uganda offered free universal primary education and universal secondary education. As a result, the enrolment of school-going children in Uganda had risen from 5,303,564 in 1997, when universal primary education had come into effect, to 8,374,587 in 2010. The Government had a policy of affirmative action in favour of the girl child. 11. To ensure the registration of all children at birth, the Government had an automated system that registered all births at the community level. 12. Uganda was a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and had enacted the Persons with Disabilities Act, 2006. The Act promoted affirmative action for persons with disabilities including in the areas of education, voting rights and the right to work. Persons with disabilities were represented in both Parliament and Local Councils.  13. The delegation stated that the right to life was guaranteed by article 22 of the Constitution, which stipulated that no person shall be deprived of the right to life except in execution of a sentence passed by a competent Court in a fair trial. The right was also extended to the unborn child. The retention of the death penalty for capital offences was the result of the recommendation of the Constitutional Review Commission, which had found that the majority of Ugandans supported the use of the death penalty for capital offences. However, the death penalty as a punishment had been responsibly invoked. The last execution had been carried out in 1999. A person might receive a reprieve through the prerogative of mercy. A body of case law had also developed that clarified that the death penalty was no longer mandatory even for capital offences, but that it was discretionary and that the decision rested entirely in the hands of the presiding judge. 14. Freedom of assembly was a constitutional right enshrined in article 29 of the Constitution, which must be enjoyed along with the constitutional duty of non-interference with the rights of others, as provided by article 43. 15. Article 29, paragraph 1 (e), of the Constitution, guaranteed the right to freedom of association, including the freedom to form and join associations or unions. In the case of political parties, those provisions had been operationalized through the Political Parties and Organisations Act 2005. The Act provided for Government to contribute funds or other public resources towards activities of political parties and organizations represented in Parliament.  16. In a 2005 referendum on the political system, Ugandans had voted in favour of lifting the ban on political parties; the ban was subsequently lifted through a Constitutional amendment.   17. Article 29, paragraph 1 (a), of the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of speech and expression. The Press and Journalist Act ensured press freedom, established an institute of journalists and also provided for a council to regulate the mass media. The Courts had pronounced themselves on the law of sedition as being inconsistent with the Constitution and had recommended that it be removed from the Penal Code.  18. The delegation stated that articles 24 and 25 of the Constitution guaranteed protection from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Uganda was in the process of domesticating the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) through the enactment of the Anti-Torture Bill. The Bill sought, inter alia, to hold those who torture individually liable for their acts. In the event of excessive use of force, the aggrieved persons would be entitled to remedies by the Uganda Human Rights Commission and courts of law. 19. Article 59 of the Constitution guaranteed Ugandan citizens 18 years and older the right to vote. Article 61 provided for the holding of regular, free and fair elections. In line with that provision, Uganda had held Presidential, Parliamentary and Local Council elections in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011. Over time, the management of the electoral process had improved, with the 2011 general elections widely acknowledged as more peaceful in relation to the past. 20. Article 30 of the Constitution guaranteed all persons the right to education. Furthermore, article XVIII of the National Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy mandated the State to promote free and compulsory basic education, and to take appropriate measures to afford every citizen equal opportunity to attain the highest educational standard possible. Parliament had enacted several laws to operationalize those Constitutional provisions. The Government had introduced free universal primary education in 1997 and universal secondary education in 2007. 21. The share of the national budget allocated to education had been increasing; i.e., from 13.7 per cent (1990) to 24.7 per cent (2008). In the 2010/2011 budget, funds for the education sector had increased to 1.13 trillion Ugandan shillings, up from 1 trillion in 2009.  22. The Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development handled, inter alia, gender-related issues. Article 33 of the Constitution guaranteed the rights of women. The Domestic Violence Act 2010 was aimed at protecting victims of domestic violence and punishing perpetrators. To curb the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), Parliament passed the Prevention of Female Genital Mutilation Act 2009. It criminalized the practice of FGM, provided for the prosecution of offenders and sought to protect victims. Consultations were ongoing on the Marriage and Divorce Bill. The Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act 2010 comprehensively addressed human trafficking. 23. The National Women.s Council promoted the role of women in national development. The National Development Plan outlined measures to mainstream gender issues in all aspects of development. The National Action Plan on Women had been adopted to promote gender mainstreaming in all development plans and programmes.  24. The delegation emphasized the Government.s commitment to strengthening the legal and institutional framework to fight corruption. The legal framework comprised the Anti-Corruption Act and the Leadership Code. The institutional framework included the Anti-Corruption Court, the Inspectorate of Government, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions and the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament. Those were aimed at strengthening the investigative and prosecutorial functions.  25. Article 31, paragraph 2 (a), of the Constitution prohibited marriage between persons of the same sex. Sections 145 and 146 of the Penal Code prohibited same-sex relations. While the Constitution, under chapter four, guaranteed the rights of all persons, the promotion and protection of human rights must be carried out within the social and cultural context. Such practices remained a matter of private choice.  26. Challenges existed regarding capacity-building, mainstreaming of human rights issues in all aspects of governance, poverty, public awareness of human rights issues, corruption, infrastructural development and climate change.  27. The Government had adopted a recommendation for a National Action Plan to be developed as part of a follow-up mechanism on issues raised in the review and recommendations. Specific measures would be taken to strengthen the capacities of various human rights institutions, including the provision of financial, logistical and technical support, as well as human resource development, to enable them to effectively fulfil their respective mandates. 28. There was a well-defined strategy for sensitization and the raising of public awareness on human rights issues from the grass-roots to the national level through, inter alia, civic education by the Uganda Human Rights Commission; voter education by the Electoral Commission; and efforts to inculcate human rights, voter education and civic education in the education curriculum of schools. Mainstreaming human rights issues was included in the training curricula of security agencies. 29. Measures were needed to address the challenge of a costly justice system, especially for the poor, by making the legal process less technical and more affordable and strengthening and promoting pro bono legal services. 30. Anti-corruption measures were strengthened through comprehensive forfeiture laws and practices against all those found guilty of corruption; the imposition of stiff custodial sentences; and the strengthened oversight function of Parliament on accounting, procurement and internal audit function. 31. The Government had further committed itself to the institutionalization of an annual review of the human rights situation in the country. It was also committed to establishing a human rights department, whose mandate would be defined in consultation with the Uganda Human Rights Commission, and a Standing Committee of Cabinet on Human Rights to provide policy guidance on human rights issues.  32. The delegation concluded by stating that Uganda had the political will and adequate legal, policy and institutional frameworks and measures for addressing issues pertaining to the sustainable promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights.   B.

Despite its ratification of CAT, Uganda still had no national legislation criminalizing the practice, while a number of allegations of ill-treatment had been attributed to the police and the army.

It was also concerned at difficulties regarding the realization of the right to education. Poland made recommendations.  53. Belgium welcomed the de facto moratorium on the use of the death penalty and the Supreme Court.s upholding of the 2005 ruling by the Constitutional Court, according to which mandatory death sentences and delays in execution of more than three years were unconstitutional. It regretted the reports on limitations of freedom of expression, association and demonstration. Belgium made recommendations. 54. Denmark noted that Uganda had not yet domesticated CAT.

Australia also urged Uganda to ensure that provisions concerning freedom of assembly and expressions were in conformity with international standards. Australia made recommendations.  59. The delegation thanked the States for their comments and positive contributions to the report. The death penalty as a punishment had been responsibly invoked; for example, the last execution had been carried out in 1999. The death sentence was no longer mandatory, even for capital offences, following the Supreme Court ruling of January 2009; those on death row and not executed within three years had their sentences automatically commuted to life.  60. On issues related to excessive force, the Government policy was that the individual officers were personally responsible and accountable for actions committed outside the law.  61. On freedom of association, the delegation reported that consultations, with all stakeholders, on the draft public order management bill were ongoing. Through the bill, the Government sought to regulate public demonstrations and assemblies and also lay down the responsibilities of all parties concerned. 62. On the issue of blocking rallies, the Government did not block rallies of political parties, except when such rallies were organized at places where the general public security, safety and livelihood were threatened.  63. On personal liberty, arbitrary arrests and unlawful detentions, the challenge, especially for the grass-roots population, was a lack of awareness about their rights and about the procedures to follow when their human rights were infringed on.  64. On the freedom of expression, the Press and Journalist Amendment Bill 2010 had been drafted in consultation with various stakeholders. It was yet to be tabled before Parliament. Meanwhile, additional comments from the public were still welcome, including during consideration by Parliament of the bill. 65. As to the media and criminal laws, legal avenues existed for redress where anyone felt his or her rights had been infringed upon. 66. While Uganda had signed the Optional Protocol to CAT, consultations were still ongoing with various stakeholders on its ratification. The Anti-Torture Bill was before Parliament.  67. On illegal detention, Uganda had experienced an unprecedented wave of terrorism around 1998 and 2000. All detention centres were gazetted and accessible to the general public. Article 23, paragraph 4, of the Constitution provided for a maximum period of 48 hours within which a suspect must be produced in court where he or she can apply for a writ of habeas corpus. A law enforcement actor acting outside these provisions would be personally liable for his actions. The police had measures in place to ensure that preliminary investigations were undertaken prior to the arrest of a suspect to comply with that Constitutional requirement. 68. Regarding the non-prosecution of officers, the delegation stated that that was a baseless assertion when considering that 36 police officers of the Rapid Response Unit had been charged in court for various torture-related offences. 69. As compensation claims were not predictable, they could not be fully budgeted for. In most cases, they were beyond the resources provided for in the budgets during a specific year, warranting them to be carried forward. Where resources were available claims were paid on a first-in, first-out basis, and a Compensation Committee had been established to handle the awards. 70. On health, the delegation reported that the Government had proposed the National Health Insurance Scheme in order to improve the internal mobilization of resources with formal and private sector contributions.   71. With regard to dilapidated health facilities and Regional Referral Hospitals, a capital development fund averaging 1.5 billion Ugandan shillings annually since the 2008/9 fiscal year was provided for construction, equipment, and staff transport.  72. On LGBTI persons, any individual who felt his or her rights had been infringed by the provisions of the law was free to go to court for redress or to initiate a process for the amendment of specific provisions of the law. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill was before Parliament. As for the plight of human rights defenders, the delegation stated that the Government did not condone violence against anyone. There was no evidence to corroborate the assertion that those who had left were being targeted. Regarding LGBTI organizations, Uganda laws did not discriminate against any organization wishing to register. What was important was that such an organization must meet the criteria as provided for in the NGO Registration (Amendment) Act 2009.  73. Regarding health-related discrimination, the delegation indicated that the HIV policy of Uganda was not discriminatory. According to laws and medical ethics, medical practitioners were under obligation not to discriminate and/or disclose personal medical records to third parties. 74. Rwanda noted with satisfaction the efforts in areas such as education, the rights of the child, women.s rights, and the right to health. It noted the ratification by Uganda of many international and regional instruments. It also acknowledged the State.s efforts in facing identified challenges and constraints in the promotion, protection and realization of human rights. Rwanda made recommendations. 75. Slovenia asked Uganda what measures had been taken: (a) to prevent malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS; (b) to stop the widespread discrimination against persons with disabilities and to provide them with equal opportunities; and (c) to prevent child abuse and rehabilitate children who had been used in hostilities. Slovenia expressed concern at gender inequality and harmful traditional practices. Slovenia made recommendations. 76. Mozambique noted that Uganda had ratified the core human rights instruments and had taken steps to domesticate many of them. Mozambique applauded Uganda for the gains in the area of health. It noted that the Government was allocating a larger budget to education. Mozambique also praised Uganda for adopting a recommendation for a national action plan on human rights. Mozambique made a recommendation.  77. Hungary noted the efforts of Uganda to draw up an institutional and legal framework for the implementation of the human rights instruments to which the country was party. It welcomed the commitment to the prevention of genocide and the collaboration with the OHCHR presence in the country; however, it stated that there was room for improvement regarding cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms. Hungary made recommendations. 78. Turkey noted the anti-corruption measures initiated by the Government. Turkey praised the relevant articles of the Constitution guaranteeing protection from torture and the ratification of CAT. Turkey noted the increase in the number of women in Parliament and encouraged participation of women at the local level. Turkey made recommendations.  79. Argentina commended Uganda on the inclusion of a human rights perspective in its National Development Plan for 2015. Argentina made recommendations. 80. The United Kingdom encouraged Uganda to take concrete steps to improve the implementation of constitutional laws and institutions for respecting human rights. It recognized the Government.s work to address discrimination against women, but noted that key laws in that regard had not been passed. It also urged the Government to take steps to tackle discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. It made recommendations.  81. Burkina Faso commended the adoption of the Domestic Violence Act of 2010 aimed at the protection of victims and criminal prosecution of perpetrators. It also welcomed the adoption of a national plan of action for women to promote gender mainstreaming. It appreciated the commitment by Uganda to enforce its plan of action for children enlisted in the State.s armed forces. It made recommendations. 82. The Holy See acknowledged the efforts by Uganda regarding legal, policy and institutional areas, including the creation of the national human rights institution. It supported the State.s protection of the rights to life and of the natural family and congratulated Uganda for reducing HIV/AIDS. It noted challenges regarding poverty, health conditions, primary education; and the phenomena of child soldiers and child labour. It made recommendations. 83.

Spain congratulated Uganda for the non-approval of the Anti-Homosexual Act. It noted that Uganda had signed an action plan regarding children associated with armed forces, as well as its efforts to implement it. Spain welcomed the State.s cooperation with OHCHR. Spain made recommendations. 85. Sweden noted that the Constitution of Uganda provided for the freedoms of expression and assembly; however, it was concerned about the proposed Press and Journalist Bill 2010 that would create new offences against freedom of expression. It also noted that the Ugandan Penal Code criminalized same-sex sexual conduct in private between consenting adults. It welcomed the de facto moratorium on executions. Sweden made recommendations. 86. Chile acknowledged the commitment by Uganda to implement its plan of action regarding children in armed conflict. It congratulated Uganda for the ÒAÓ status of its national commission of human rights. It expressed concern at information on restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly and inquired as to the position of Uganda in that regard. Chile made recommendations. 87. Ghana acknowledged both the commitment of and the concerted efforts by the Government to honour its human rights obligations. It commended Uganda for adopting the National Action Plan on Women. Ghana welcomed the Government.s adoption of a recommendation for a national action plan to be developed as a part of a follow-up mechanism. Ghana made recommendations. 88.
