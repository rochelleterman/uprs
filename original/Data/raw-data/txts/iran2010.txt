Presentation by the State under review 5. Welcoming the review of the Islamic Republic of Iran as an opportunity to enhance knowledge about the situation of human rights in the country, the delegation of Iran remarked that it was through cooperation, respect and a willingness to listen to one another that a culture of human rights could be promoted. 6. The delegation noted that the 1979 Islamic Revolution had led to the creation of a new system of democratic polity and social and civil order based on Islamic rationality. It underscored explicit and extensive human rights references in the Constitution, such as chapter 7, on “The right of people”. Article 6 provides that all major decisions on all matters, including representation in high office, should be based on the people’s consent. It noted that the judiciary was independent from the executive and legislative branches, with the requisite principles to ensure due process. 7. In 2005, the High Council of Human Rights, established in 2001 to improve coordination, became the highest institution entrusted with supervision, monitoring and guidance of different sections on human rights. 8. The delegation noted the country’s diverse ethnic and religious composition and the variety of traditions, customs and languages that made it a model of brotherly and amicable coexistence. In order to nurture that relationship and ensure that all nationals enjoyed the same infrastructure for growth, projects aimed at job creation, providing health services, education and housing, and promoting the civil and political rights of ethnic communities had been developed to improve economic, social and cultural indicators in less developed areas. 9. With regard to the challenges facing Iran, the delegation stated that its human rights situation had consistently been used by some Western countries to apply political pressure and advance ulterior political motives. Terrorism supported by foreign countries constituted a serious problem. Following the invasion of its neighbouring countries, the presence and operations of terrorist groups in Iran’s border areas had increased considerably, and terrorist groups had killed, threatened or abducted thousands of ordinary citizens and had proceeded to plunder public and private property. 10. The delegation added that, after the invasion of Afghanistan by coalition forces, narcotic drug production and trafficking had drastically increased, posing a serious security and health threat. It expressed regret at the fact that the country’s efforts to prevent drug trafficking had not received recognition or financial or technical support. 11. The delegation also underlined the negative impact on the realization of all aspects of human rights of unilateral and coercive as well as international sanctions, imposed by certain Western countries and the Security Council, respectively. 12. The Iranian delegation stressed its continuous and full cooperation with OHCHR and the extension of a standing invitation to all thematic special procedures. Several Special Rapporteurs had visited the country, with further visits under consideration. Iran had made thorough and timely responses to communications by mandate holders. Reports to several treaty bodies had been submitted in a timely manner, and concluding observations had been disseminated. 13. The Islamic Republic of Iran highlighted the contributions it had made in human rights forums, including to standard-setting and literature, and emphasized the significance of an interactive and cooperative approach and the avoidance of confrontation, double standards and politicization. 14. The delegation underscored Iran’s contribution to three General Assembly resolutions, entitled “Enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human rights”, “Human rights and unilateral coercive measures” and “Human rights and cultural diversity”.  15. Similarly, the 2007 Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement on Human Rights and Cultural Diversity and the establishment of the Centre for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity had created a framework for promoting respect for cultural diversity and institutionalizing intercultural dialogue on human rights. 16. On the national level, the delegation cited the role of the Iranian parliament in promoting human rights through legislation and the establishment of new programmes. It also cited the human rights structures of parliament as described in Iran’s national report. Among the issues addressed by recent legislative acts of parliament, the delegation cited, inter alia, citizenship rights; the rights of women and children, religious and ethnic minorities and disabled persons; freedom of expression; human trafficking; and social security. Programmes and laws currently under consideration were related to issues including the protection of children, young adults and victims of crime, judicial reform and criminal law reform. 17. The delegation also noted that women held eight parliamentary seats and that two vice-presidents, several presidential advisers, one minister and several deputy ministers were female.  B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 18. During the interactive dialogue, 53 delegations made statements.

It made reference to the situation facing Shi’a and Baha’i, as well as Sufi Muslims.   20. Canada noted that education and welfare programmes had improved living standards. It was seriously concerned about the deterioration in the human rights situation and violent crackdowns by security forces, especially since the 2009 elections. Peaceful public demonstrations had been met with repression, including arbitrary arrest, detention without due process, ill treatment and torture, deaths in custody, and restrictions on the freedoms of expression, assembly and association.  21. France expressed concern at the fact that the human rights situation had deteriorated over the previous eight months and at the repression of people peacefully exercising their rights. It noted that dozens had been killed and thousands imprisoned since the elections, also noting reports of torture and rape. Concern was expressed at the increase in the number of executions. 22. Slovenia cited the situation of writers and journalists in jail and the conditions facing ethnic and religious minorities, particularly the Baha’i, and asked if Iran intended to prevent the further harassment and intimidation of Baha’i, particularly children. It condemned the increasing recourse to death sentences and executions in connection with the post-election protests.  23. Israel noted Iran’s large-scale and escalating attacks on Iranian citizens. It noted that women, minorities and their defenders were being discriminated against. It noted that there was no freedom of expression, assembly or religion. Israel added that the Council’s work on Iran ought to go beyond the present review. 24. Australia was concerned at the use of capital punishment, including stoning, particularly for juveniles, and at the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, especially the adherents of the Baha’i faith and its detained leaders, whose trials had recently begun. Concern was also expressed at the suppression of peaceful demonstrations after the elections and at the impact on freedom of expression, association and assembly, as well as at the reported arbitrary arrest, detention and torture of protesters. 25. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland noted Iran’s stated commitment to safeguarding human rights.

It stated that historical, cultural and religious particularities should be taken into account during the present review, especially the fact that Iran must respect Islamic Shari’a law.  27. Brazil recognized achievements in education, poverty eradication and well-being. It noted Iran’s standing invitation to special procedures and that it could facilitate pending requests for visits. It noted that the country could benefit from cooperation with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on child labour and street children.

It encouraged Iran to engage in dialogue domestically, permitting free expression. Brazil noted that the Baha’i should enjoy rights extended to others and that imprisoned Baha’i leaders should enjoy due process.  28. Cuba noted Iranians’ work for development, welfare and sovereignty. It stated that the Islamic Revolution had allowed for self-determination and had ended the dictatorship of the Shah, who had received Western armaments and technology, including nuclear technology. It highlighted the strategic plan for integral development, which addressed job creation, education, health, social security, housing and cultural rights. It noted that more than 95 per cent of Iranians had access to primary health care and that the right to education had been implemented.

It noted efforts to promote economic, social and cultural rights. It valued policies to improve health and medical services, with direct assistance planned for vulnerable sectors, providing free medical attention, as well as incentives and benefits for doctors working in rural centres, and university quotas for residents of less-privileged regions.  32. Luxembourg expressed concern at the deterioration in the human rights situation, characterized by increasing restrictions on the freedom of expression and information; an increase in the number of death penalty convictions, including of minors; convictions involving inhuman and degrading treatment, such as whipping and amputation; the harassment and repression of human rights defenders; the intensification of the repression of women’s-rights activists; and the situation of minorities, particularly ethnic and religious minorities. It expressed concern at reports of intimidation, harassment, torture, arbitrary detention, violence, confiscation, limitations on access to education or employment concerning the Baha’i community. 33. Germany, concerned about those who had participated in peaceful post-election protests, asked why Iranians’ efforts to engage in an open dialogue about the future of their country were being hampered. Quoting Iran’s national report, it asked how the country reconciled its views regarding Shari’a law and “Western standards of human rights” with its obligation to respect human rights, enshrined in the Universal Declaration and treaties that it had ratified. 34. Ireland noted with concern human rights violations, including with regard to freedom of expression, association and assembly and the use of torture. It noted reported attacks against and the detention of human rights defenders and deplored attempts to restrict peaceful demonstrations and actions. It noted with concern the high incidence of the death penalty and its use in cases involving minors. Ireland was concerned about serious deficiencies in the area of gender equality and about reports of the systematic torture of prisoners and people in detention. 35. Pakistan noted Iran’s constitutional provisions and laws guaranteeing human rights and the elaborate judicial system, the High Council on Human Rights and the proposed national human rights institution, as well as the high standards set in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, particularly health care, social security, high literacy rates and the rights of disabled persons. It encouraged Iran to take all steps necessary, in accordance with the laws of the land and international obligations, to ensure the protection of its citizens’ rights.  36. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya highlighted Iran’s legislation on human rights and the principles governing the judiciary, in particular independence, impartiality, the rule of law and public trials. It also noted the creation of the Supreme Council on Human Rights, expanded in 2007, and its position in the governmental hierarchy, as well as the establishment of the council on women and the family. 37. Algeria acknowledged that Iran was an emerging democracy facing challenges in its transition. Noting the establishment of several human rights institutions, it asked about the coordination of their actions. It noted the increased number of human rights non.governmental organizations and their role, and encouraged Iran to continue to promote their participation in human rights forums. It commended Iran for initiatives supporting cultural diversity and for having been a long-standing and generous host to a substantial refugee population. 38. Bahrain commended Iran’s commitment to human rights and noted its intention to cooperate with human rights mechanisms. It noted that, despite the obstacles Iran faced, strategies and programmes to strengthen education were being implemented. It asked about the right of and access to education, especially at the university level.

It hoped that Iran would soon ratify the Convention against Torture and CEDAW. It noted with concern reports of repression and increasing incidents limiting freedom of expression, as well as the arrest, detention and execution of political activists. 40. In response to the issues raised, the Iranian delegation noted that the State had promoted mechanisms for the adjudication of legal disputes and various methods for proper supervision and implementation. The judicial system was guided by the principles of non.discrimination and due process. 41. According to the law on criminal procedure, in cases of explicit crimes, the police could hold a suspect in custody for a maximum of 24 hours, after which he or she must be brought before a juge d’ instruction. 42. On questions relating to Baha’is, the delegation stressed that, while Baha’i was not recognized as an official religion, its followers enjoyed citizenship rights. Limitations on some Baha’i students were a result of their failure to meet admission requirements.  43. Regarding concerns about the recent illegal demonstrations on the day of Ashura, the delegation stated that arrests had been made for offences against the law, such as the defamation of sanctities and the destruction of public property.  44. With regard to prison conditions, facilities were provided for the humane treatment of and respect for the dignity and rights of prisoners, and for the prohibition of harm and harassment. At an international conference, the Prisons Organization had received an award for the management of criminals and their re-socialization. Human rights training courses had been held for prison staff and managers. Prisoners also had access to high- school education and distance university education. Moreover, Iran had attempted to eliminate solitary prison cells where possible and to expand their size. 45. The delegation added that the sentence of execution was recognized in international human rights documents and the legal systems of many countries. Iran considered execution as permissible only for the most serious crimes and after due process, including review by the Supreme Court. 46. Stressing the values of Iran’s democratic system, the delegation noted that more than 32 elections had been held over the previous three decades, permitting the participation of all political parties, which had various orientations. More than 40 million people had cast their votes in the June 2009 presidential elections. Cast ballots had been meticulously collected and counted, with the participation of legal and official inspectors and some 90,000 independent observers. 47. Legitimate protests would be a post facto symptom of free and democratic elections, but the repercussions of this election were related to foreign powers meddling in Iran’s internal affairs. Iran had addressed the protests through various legal and judicial procedures, the delegation stated. All cases were being duly and openly addressed in competent courts, and defendants had access to their chosen lawyers. High-ranking judicial officials meticulously examined allegations of rights violations. The delegation called for respect for democracy and ensuring the integrity of the vote of the majority in sovereign States. 48. Regarding freedom of assembly, the delegation cited figures showing that on average, more than 5,000 public demonstrations, marches and assemblies were held annually in Iran.

It warned that such activists seeking asylum under human rights pretexts would block the fight against fatal terrorism internationally. 49. Indonesia noted the formulation of legislation aimed at the establishment of a national human rights institution and the upcoming drafting of a strategic national action plan on human rights. Indonesia welcomed policies to promote women’s representation in political and judicial institutions and to broaden the scope of their rights, and acknowledged the human rights training of judges and law enforcement personnel. 50. New Zealand noted that Iran’s post-election response had fallen short of international human rights standards and expressed concern about the scale and nature of violence. It welcomed the closure of the Kahrizak detention facility and the Majlis’ investigation into alleged violations of detainees’ rights. It noted that the use of torture for punitive purposes had not been criminalized and that, despite the moratorium on stoning, it persisted as a Shari’a court-mandated punishment.

It noted that at least 20 people had been killed in post-election protests and hundreds injured, also citing concerns of the High Commissioner for Human Rights about increasing arrests and the possible illegal use of excessive force. It welcomed the drafting of legislation aimed at establishing a national human rights institution and its forthcoming presentation to the Islamic Consultative Assembly. 52. Qatar noted that the national report reflected developments in the field of human rights, in addition to efforts taken to improve the promotion and protection of human rights and the economic and social conditions of Iran’s citizens. 53. Kazakhstan noted Iran’s history, culture and educated population, which bore the hallmarks of a free society.

It noted that the Government had accorded high priority to the establishment of a national human rights institution. 58. India noted improved living standards through economic growth and welfare programmes. Progress on health care and literacy, an active civil society and cooperation with UNICEF and the United Nations Development Programme on child rights and capacity-building were acknowledged.

India requested Iran to strengthen the empowerment of women, including by acceding to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; developmental efforts for vulnerable groups, including religious minorities; the machinery for civil and political rights; and Iran’s human rights education programme. Iran was also requested to consider establishing a national human rights institution compliant with the Paris Principles.  59. Italy was concerned at the systematic use of capital punishment, especially against juveniles. It noted that, while the Constitution protected freedom of expression, press and political activity, reports of grave violations of those rights had emerged, especially in the aftermath of the presidential elections. Those worrying developments were not consistent with Iran’s candidature for the Human Rights Council.

Progress in fighting illiteracy was also acknowledged. 63. Concerning questions regarding the rights of religious minorities, the delegation noted, citing constitutional provisions, that there was no discriminatory approach in the laws and policies of Iran. The recognized religious minorities were fully free to practice their faiths, to conduct their education and to own numerous sacred places and cemeteries. 64. Numerous actions had been taken to increase the participation of religious minorities in various socio-political arenas and decision-making processes, including through the election of representatives in parliament. Religious minorities were present in town and village councils, benefiting from Government financial assistance. They also published media, owned schools, cultural centres and sacred places, and were active in various professions in the economic field, as well as in civil society. Twenty-seven churches were registered on Iran’s national heritage list, and the ancient sacred Tatavoos Church had been nominated for registration on the world heritage list. 65. The delegation also highlighted the significant advancement of Iranian women since the Islamic Revolution, as a result of strategic national polices and programmes for their economic, social and cultural development.

It praised the protection of Armenian Christian cultural monuments in Iran.  69. Austria noted Iranian laws guaranteeing due process and banning torture. However, it cited reports concerning a high number of illegal arrests, incommunicado detention and torture, rape and murder by security officials, and inquired about the Government’s plans to investigate and prosecute those responsible. Austria expressed concern about the apparently disproportionate application of the death penalty against members of minority groups and political activists. 70. Mexico asked for details about the implementation of the work plan for technical cooperation between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and OHCHR in relation to the judiciary. 71. The Netherlands expressed grave concern about extrajudicial and arbitrary detention, suspects being held without information on charges, the absence of due process and the possible use of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. It welcomed the fact that the Iranian Government had assumed responsibility for guaranteeing equal rights for men and women.  72. Kyrgyzstan highlighted several initiatives in the judicial area, including 14 investigations related to human rights. It noted activities to promote human rights, such as training courses and the publication of books and periodicals. It welcomed cooperation with international mechanisms, such as the 2003 visit by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and plans to work with OHCHR. 73. Slovakia objected to the use of the death penalty, particularly for juveniles. It noted that, despite the 2008 announcement banning public executions, the practice was still being reported. It noted the arrest and detention of political opponents, human rights defenders, journalists, students, intellectuals, religious representatives and ordinary citizens. Independent press had faced tightened restrictions since the 2009 elections, and the Internet was heavily censored. It noted widespread violence against women and a lack of redress for victims. 74. Belgium recognized Iran’s intention to accede to CEDAW, but remained concerned at existing discriminatory legal provisions and at the arrest, harassment, intimidation, persecution and sentencing of women’s-rights activists. It also noted the prescription of the death penalty for a large number of crimes and its application for the violation of minimum standards. It urged the abolition of the death penalty.  75. Denmark expressed concern about the crackdowns imposed on demonstrators since the presidential election and cited reports of extrajudicial killings, rapes, torture and violations of the right to freedom of assembly and expression, as well as thousands of arbitrary arrests.

It noted recent reports of human rights violations against religious minorities and human rights defenders. It asked about measures to prevent persecution and discrimination on religious grounds. 80. China noted the constitutional human rights guarantees and the existence of human rights institutions in all legislative, judicial and administrative departments. The Twenty-Year Vision Strategic Plan for development and other policies and measures had resulted in progress in employment, health, education and social security, it added. China welcomed Iran’s commitment to advocating a human rights dialogue and cooperation, and its efforts to promote cultural diversity.

It recognized the fact that the Majlis, elected by direct vote, had a Human Rights Committee and was becoming more inclusive, with women and representatives of religious minorities. Bolivia encouraged Iran to continue to include more women in that body. It highlighted Iran’s commitment to the Civil Code amendment, allowing widows to inherit. It encouraged Iran to continue to work to eradicate discrimination. 85. The head of Iran’s delegation stated that he had been a political dissident under the Shah, a regime that had enjoyed the support of many countries today accusing Iran. He noted that Iran was becoming one of the prominent democratic States in the region. While cooperation and dialogue were appreciated, double standards and political incentives were noted. 86. In response to invitations recently extended, the High Commissioner would visit Iran in 2011, he said. A standing invitation had also been extended to Special Rapporteurs. In terms of technical cooperation, an agenda had been approved. 87. The swift closure, based on existing legal procedures, of the Kahrizak detention centre after the discovery of wrongdoing was emphasized and compared with the situation in other countries. While wrongdoing occurred in Iran as in all States, including with regard to violence against women, the issue should be whether it was a policy of the State. In Islamic States, including Iran, women are very much respected, he noted. 88. The delegation stated that it had taken serious note of the recommendation, hoping that a spirit of cooperation, dialogue and positive-minded engagement would be pursued. 89. The value of culture and history for the enrichment of the human rights experience was highlighted, with the delegation noting that the liberal Western way of life was not the only one to follow.
