Concerning recommendations 117.10 and 117.11, put forward by France and Switzerland respectively, Nicaragua would have preferred that they be split into two because it has different positions regarding the two international instruments listed therein. Since this was not possible, the delegation had been forced to place both recommendations in the group of those which do not enjoy the support of Nicaragua and, thus, are noted. The Nicaraguan State has a transparent and well-known position on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, for which it cannot accept any recommendation that requires accession to that international instrument. Nonetheless, the State will sovereignly consider the possibility of becoming a party to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. The Government will send its views vis-�-vis this international instrument along with the position of those recommendations contained in paragraph 116. \n",
