## Change Logs / Questions

### Institutions:

Erin added some but I think we should stop included more unless they're really significant.

**Changes**:

No major.

**Issues**:

1. 'Core' is still doing poorly

### Action:

**Changes**:

No major.

**Issues:**

None

### Theme:

The worst ones here were 'pol-imprisonment', 'civil-so', 'ethnic', 'police'

**Changes:**

No major.

**Issues:**

1. 'pol.imprisonment' was often confused with 'prisoners' and/or 'civil society'
2. Erin asked if there was a 'human rights defenders' code. This should be included in 'civil-so'. Make sure the codebook specifies that 'civil society' includes 'human rights defenders'.
4. 'Race' and 'ethnic' were often confused.
