The review of Viet Nam was held at the 10th meeting on 8 May 2009. The delegation of Viet Nam was headed by H.E. Pham Binh Minh, First Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs. At its meeting held on 12 May 2009, the Working Group adopted the present report on Viet Nam. 2. On 8 September 2008, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Viet Nam: Burkina Faso, Canada and Japan. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were issued for the review of Viet Nam: (a) A national report submitted in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VNM/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VNM/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VNM/3). 4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Viet Nam through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. H.E. Pham Binh Minh, First Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that Viet Nam attaches importance to the UPR national report, regarding it as a United Nations member’s obligation and an opportunity for comprehensive and participatory review of its human rights achievements and future measures. A special task force composed of members from more than 20 national legislative, judiciary and administrative departments was established. To make the report was as comprehensive, objective and authoritative as possible, consultations were held with dozen of NGOs and academic institutions. Viet Nam has also learnt from international experience and received cooperation from international partners in many ways. The UPR report and nearly 100 pages of annexes provide detailed information on the human rights implementation. 6. Viet Nam pursues a consistent policy of respecting and ensuring human rights as enshrined in its Constitution. This policy stems from the recognition that human rights are the universal values of mankind, including the right to national self-determination which is upheld in today’s core human rights conventions. 7. The policy is also rooted in Viet Nam’s thousands of years of history and culture. Fifty-four ethnic groups have been living together in peace on the Vietnamese soil without any ethnic conflict. The Vietnamese people love peace and humane values while staying open to diversity and outside values, including the major religions like Buddhism and Christianity that have come to thrive in Viet Nam since very early. The will of Viet Nam also represents the aspirations of the Vietnamese people throughout the colonial rule that deprived them of the most fundamental freedoms and the war of national defence following Viet Nam’s regained independence in 1945.  8. The people’s support stands behind the success of the independent Viet Nam in overcoming enormous ordeals and hardships and in leading the comprehensive renewal process recognized by the international community. This support indeed demonstrates the enjoyment by the people of their human rights.  9. Viet Nam attaches great importance to building a comprehensive legal system to guarantee and promote human rights. About 13,000 laws and by-laws have been enacted or revised since 1986. Draft laws and ordinances of the National Assembly are subjected to people’s comments via the mass media. The Constitution and legal normative documents stipulate the rights and measures to guarantee civil and political human rights in Viet Nam in conformity with international treaties. Viet Nam’s efforts in this regard have been commended by the United Nations and international partners. 10. The monitoring and supervising system and the law enforcement system in Viet Nam, which are constantly reformed in accordance with the principle of a State ruled by law, encompass all State agencies and various organizations and people’s participation. The National Assembly supervises all activities of the State. All its Q&A sessions with Government members are broadcast live.  11. The Master Plan on Administrative Reform 2001–2010 is aimed at making the administrative system cleaner, stronger, more democratic, professional, modern and effective in the people’s interest. All Government agencies have their own inspecting mechanism in their respective areas of responsibility. The judicial system serves as the means for protection of justice and human rights, for enforcement of the law and the fight against crimes and law violations. 12. Various organizations, the mass media and citizens’ indirect and direct participation through their representative bodies or legal mechanisms are important components of the machinery of human rights protection. The people take voluntary and active part in running for election, nominating and voting representatives from different social strata into the governing bodies at all levels. Many raise their concerns and questions to their representatives related to the functioning of the State agencies. Q&A sessions of the National Assembly are closely watched by the people. Viet Nam has about 380 nationwide mass associations and numerous associations at the local and grassroots levels. There are 18 nationwide sectoral trade unions and 6,020 local trade unions. Some 600 foreign NGOs operate in Viet Nam. 13. The mass media have been growing rapidly in diverse forms and with rich content, becoming important forums for the people and contributing actively to the process of renewal, the fight against corruption and other vices. The number of print press agencies and publications now reach 700 and 850 respectively, tripling the 1990 figure. Over 15,000 licensed journalists are working in Viet Nam. Regular Internet users account for nearly 24 per cent of the population, which is higher than the Asian average of 18 per cent. Presently 95 per cent communes of extreme difficulties have radio stations, including those broadcasting in ethnic minority languages. According to a recent ITU report, Viet Nam was among the top 10 countries in 2002–2007 in terms of the growth rate of IT coverage, usage and skills. 14. Religious and belief activities are now a vibrant social feature. There are over 20 million followers of different religions. Over 80 per cent of the population has a belief. The United Nations Day of Vesak was organized in Hanoi in 2008 with the participation of Buddhists and dignitaries from 74 countries and territories. Viet Nam will host the World Buddhist Summit in 2010. A Holy See delegation comes to Viet Nam annually to exchange views on religious issues of mutual interest and acknowledges positive developments in the life of catholic community.  15. Members of ethnic minorities participate in an increasingly equal manner in the country’s socio-political life. The twelfth National Assembly (2007–2011) includes 87 deputies of ethnic minorities, accounting for nearly 18 per cent of all deputies. Ethnic minority members are present in the People’s Council at provincial, district and communal levels and assume high positions, including the highest portfolio, in State agencies and varied organizations. 16. Viet Nam has attained significant achievements in promoting women’s rights as measured by CEDAW indicators. It has been rated by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank as the Asian country most rapidly narrowing the gender gap in the past 20 years. Vulnerable groups, such as children and people with disabilities, receive special attention from the State, society and family. Children and people with disabilities have been able to enjoy better care and protection in various fields and to express views on issues of interest to them in line with CRC and CPD. Viet Nam was the second country in the world and the first in Asia to sign CRC and it signed CRPD.  17. Protection and promotion of economic, social and cultural rights in Viet Nam have made significant progress. Efforts to deal with social problems have brought about tangible, positive changes. People’s cultural life is advanced. After 20 years of renewal, per capita income has increased five-fold and the percentage of households living under the national poverty line decreased from about 60 per cent to 13 per cent. Viet Nam has been recognized by the United Nations and many development partners as one of the countries with the most impressive achievements in poverty reduction. As reported by the United Nations, Viet Nam had attained or surpassed many of the MDGs and was capable of attaining them all by 2015. 18. The percentage of poor ethnic minority households has been reduced by 3 to 5 per cent per year; 90 to 95 per cent of school-age children are enrolled and all districts have secondary schools. Thirty ethnic minority groups have their own languages and scripts and ethnic minority languages are used in primary and secondary-level textbooks and television and radio programmes for ethnic minorities. 19. The UPR report of Viet Nam has described in detail lessons drawn from achievements in protecting and promoting human rights. These include placement of the human being at the centre of development, the close relationship between protection of human rights and national independence and sovereignty, the importance of maintaining political stability, promoting economic development in parallel with expanding social welfare, and enhancing the people’s awareness of and capacity to exercise their rights. 20. These accomplishments also derive from Viet Nam’s foreign policy of openness and increasingly active participation in regional and international human rights mechanisms and activities, including those of the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Asia-Europe Meeting. Viet Nam is now working with other countries in the region to establish a human rights body of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Viet Nam also has technical cooperation and human rights dialogues with Australia, Norway, Switzerland, the United States, the European Union and other countries and international organizations.  21. A number of special rapporteurs have visited Viet Nam and the Government has recently extended invitations to five other special procedures to visit.  22. Viet Nam is conscious of the shortcomings and difficulties and challenges to be addressed. The legal system of Viet Nam still lacks coherence while remaining overlapped and even contradictory in some areas. The development of the legal system has not matched the changes in life, leading to misinterpretation and difficulties in enforcement, affecting efforts to ensure constitutionality, feasibility and transparency. The effectiveness of information provision, education and awareness enhancement in relation to the law remains limited. The system of law enforcement needs to be strengthened. A segment of public servants remain unfamiliar with the human rights treaties to which Viet Nam is party and occasionally have insufficient knowledge of government policies and the law. 23. These shortcomings have objective causes, including the fact that Viet Nam remains a poor country that has to cope with the aftermaths of war, for example by supporting the many victims of bombs, mines and Agent Orange/dioxin. The population is scattered throughout the country, including in remote and harsh areas with varying languages, customs and habits. The international environment with major economic upheavals, the outbreak of pandemics, environmental degradation and transnational crimes, is another factor. Viet Nam is still victim of hostile activities like terrorism, sabotage, and attempts to destabilize the country and infringe upon national security and territorial integrity. There are subjective causes, namely the slow pace of change in some policy areas, the poor quality of implementation and the shortcomings of institutional and human capacity. 24. A number of priorities were identified in the UPR national report of Viet Nam: continue to attach importance to poverty reduction, health care, development of the social safety net and human resources, expansion and improvement of the education and training system and effective implementation of the master plan for public administration reform, the strategy for the development of the legal system and the judicial reform strategy; take specific steps to realize these priorities; accede to additional human rights treaties; and strengthen cooperation with regional and international human rights mechanisms.  25. Viet Nam is committed to building a strong country with prosperous people and a just, democratic and advanced society, to protecting and promoting democracy and human rights as both the goal and the driving force of renewal. 26. Viet Nam hopes that the working session will be a manifestation of cooperation and constructive dialogue, in line with the objectives for which the UPR mechanism was created by United Nations member States to achieve. B.

It also recommended that the Government (b) continue its efforts to preserve the language and culture of the country’s ethnic minorities.  69. In responding to statements, the delegation of Viet Nam noted the Government’s principle to guarantee social equality to allow all people to enjoy the benefits of development. The Government is determined to take stronger measures, such as additional programme in areas with a high proportion of poor households, vocational training for farmers, implementation of insurance and voluntary insurance, programmes on social housing for the poor, students, migrant workers, ethnic minorities, allocation of land for production, and provision of added resources for social safety from the State budget. The target is to bring the poverty rate below 10 per cent in 2010. 70. The delegation noted that international standards on the rights of employees and on trade unions are stipulated and protected in the Constitution and laws, and that Viet Nam has signed and ratified a number of ILO conventions. Viet Nam’s trade union has nearly 8 million members in enterprises of both State and private sectors and is the legitimate representative body in protecting the interest of employees. Viet Nam is studying the contents of the remaining conventions, including ILO Conventions 87 and 98. 71. Viet Nam will strictly enforce the law on gender equality and the law against domestic violence, which was adopted in 2006. 72. The delegation noted that Viet Nam is a unified country with 54 ethnic groups, 53 of which are minorities making up nearly 14 per cent of the population. The equal political rights of the ethnic minorities are proclaimed in the Constitution, and any ethnic-based division or discrimination is forbidden. The proportion of ethnic minorities in all levels of the administration is increasing. Nationalities enjoy equality in education and health care, and the cultural identities, language and scripts of all nationalities are preserved and promoted. Viet Nam builds houses for poor ethnic minority people, promoting education and builds boarding schools for ethnic minority students. Languages and scripts of the ethnic minorities are taught in their schools and public offices; the areas of ethnic minority people have seen rapid development and improved conditions, with places of worship preserved and upgraded. The delegation acknowledged that ethnic minority areas still lag behind in terms of development. 73. On religious issues, the State considers religion and belief a legitimate demand of the people, as proclaimed in the Constitution and legal documents. Viet Nam has 20 million followers of Buddhism, Catholicism, Protestantism and Islam, among others. Religious activities as Vesak of Buddhism, Christmas and Easter of Catholicism and Protestantism and Ramadan of Islam are organized with the participation of hundreds of thousands of followers. Viet Nam has also allocated land for the religions to build worshipping places. Religious texts have been printed in ethnic minority languages, such as Bana, Ede, Jarai and Khmer. 74. The Criminal Code had stipulated 44 offences subject to the death penalty; that was now reduced to only 29 offences and the death penalty was only applied to extremely serious crimes, such as drug trafficking and cruel murder to deter the criminals. Public opinion in Viet Nam is not yet ready for the complete removal of the death penalty. In 2006, Viet Nam revised the law on complaints and denunciation, which allows organizations and individuals to lodge lawsuits in the judicial court to review the decisions made by administrative agencies related to the legitimate rights of the plaintiff. 75. The delegation stated that Viet Nam has enacted codes, laws and provisions to ensure social safety and deal strictly with acts infringing on national security and social stability, including the 1999 Criminal Code and the 2004 Law on National Security. The laws related to national security are in conformity with Viet Nam’s socio-economic and political conditions as well as the international laws that Viet Nam has acceded to. There are no so-called “prisoners of conscience” and no one is arrested for criticizing the Government; only those who violate the laws have to bear criminal responsibility.  76. The delegation stated that any violations committed by individuals, State agencies or law enforcement officers shall be strictly dealt with in accordance with the law in force. Joining CAT is in principle in conformity with the policy and law of Viet Nam, which is taking speedy steps to join this Convention. 77. On the conditions of detention and reform of inmates and those subjected to temporary detention and investigation and interrogation, the delegation noted that all citizens have the right to complaints, and that in case of miscarriage of justice, those involved in the proceedings must compensate and can even be prosecuted criminally. The delegation reaffirmed that Vietnamese law prohibits all acts of torture and there is no practice of torture or degrading treatment of law offenders and those under detention for investigative purposes. It also stated that there are no detention camps of the military or police in Viet Nam. Every year, the State grants special amnesty for inmates with good conduct. In early 2009, 15,000 inmates were commuted and released. 78. Furthermore, the courts abide by the principle of equality, and no one is deemed guilty and punished, including being put under probation, until so found and sentenced by the court. Judges and people’s grand juries are independent and only abide by the law, and Vietnamese law has strict rules on temporary arrest and detention. The delegation referred to an increased interest in judicial reform, which aims to make court hearings more democratic and transparent. The courts have ordered cash compensation for 80 per cent of those making petitions for remedy, and the rest of the cases are being settled. 79. The delegation referred to Constitutional provisions and stated that the rapid development of the press in Viet Nam testifies to the freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right to information. The press, inter alia, monitors the implementation of laws and is indispensable for combating corruption. Every citizen has the right to provide feedback on socio-economic development plans and programmes, and many cases of corruption and wrongdoing have been detected and denounced by the people and brought to justice. With people’s feedback, authorities have cancelled or adjusted many major construction projects. The Government has implemented training and retraining programmes for over 2,000 journalists, thus helping improve the quality and reliability of the media. The law stipulates that socio-political and professional organizations are allowed to publish newspapers, and a new draft press law will consider allowing enterprises to publish newspapers.  80. Côte d’Ivoire noted that Viet Nam provides appropriate nutrition for its population and that 20 per cent of its budget is dedicated to education. It recommended that Viet Nam (a) continue and enhance efforts to reduce the level of poverty, especially for vulnerable groups, so as to boost employment, improve access to health and increase available social housing, and (b) continue reforming the judiciary and civil service and building a State based fully on the rule of law. 81. While commending the efforts, the Republic of Korea expressed concern that some parts of the rural population, ethnic minority women and children and persons with disabilities benefit little from the improved economic conditions. It recommended strengthening efforts in the areas of civil and political freedoms that include freedom of expression and the press and freedom of religion.  82. Nigeria noted challenges faced, including limited resources, inadequate training for judicial personnel and the high unemployment rate. Nigeria called on the international community to provide the necessary resources. Nigeria recommended that Viet Nam (a) ratify CPD and put in place the draft law on people with disabilities in timely fashion; (b) sign and ratify the CAT as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2007; and (c) improve prison conditions. 83. Argentina recommended that Viet Nam (a) take the necessary steps to comply with ICCPR, particularly to reduce cases of arbitrary detention and ensure that the right to a fair trial based in law is guaranteed; (b) take the necessary steps to ensure that citizens can fully enjoy these rights; (c) consider the possibility of inviting the Special Rapporteurs on freedom of expression and freedom of religion to visit the country. Argentina recommended (d) ratification of the second Optional Protocol to ICCPR to abolish the death penalty; until this happens it commends the reduced number of crimes to which this penalty is applicable and hopes that this will be done in accordance with international standards and in full transparency. Argentina recommended that Viet Nam (e) ratify CED, the Rome Statute, the Palermo Protocol and the conventions on refugees and stateless persons. It asked about experiences in reforming the judicial system, rebuilding institutions in a post-conflict situation, and on measures to reduce hunger and meet the needs of vulnerable groups. 84. South Africa noted that promotion and protection of the human rights of persons with disabilities, especially those wounded in the war, is an example of a best practice to be emulated. It recommended ratifying CPD. 85. France referred to a draft bill in 2008 to revise the criminal code to reduce the number of crimes to which capital punishment is applicable, and asked when this is likely to be approved. It asked if Viet Nam would be willing to host visits by all requesting special rapporteurs and not only those working on economic, social and cultural rights. It asked about measures to prevent, combat and eradicate discrimination and violence against persons belonging to ethnic minorities. France recommended that the Government (a) take measures advocated by the Human Rights Committee to bring to an end restrictions to freedom of expression and opinion and to end, notably, restrictions on the creation of private media at the same time; (b) set up a national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles; and (c) sign and ratify the Rome Statute.  86. Lebanon commended the ongoing efforts and noted that these have to be measured against the challenges of poverty, lack of adequate infrastructure and global crisis. Lebanon recommended that Viet Nam (a) maintain its commitment to strike a balance between the opening up of their economy and minimizing the adverse impacts on the most vulnerable and disadvantage groups in the society. It recommended that Viet Nam (b) uphold the progress it has achieved in ensuring religious freedom to the different communities and ensuring that religious and belief activities continue to be a vibrant and enriching feature of Vietnamese society. 87. Italy recommended (a) stepping up efforts to ensure the full respect of freedom of religion and worship, including by reviewing laws and provisions at all levels, related to the freedom of religion, in order to align them with article 18 of ICCPR; (b) giving a positive reply to the request to visit the country made by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion in 2008; (c) fully guaranteeing the right to receive, seek and impart information and ideas in compliance with article 19 of ICCPR; and (d) developing a national strategy to include in the school system at all levels appropriate measures in the field of human rights education in accordance with the Plan of Action 2005–2009 of the World Programme for Human Rights Education. 88. Mauritius urged the international community to continue to assist in the area of poverty reduction.

Noting reports that members of particular religious groups are facing serious limitation in the exercise of their right to freedom of religion and belief, Poland recommended (b) ensuring that legislation and the practice of the State are in full compliance with the requirements of article 18 of ICCPR. It recommended (c) repealing ordinance 44 on regulating administrative justice, which authorizes administrative detention, house arrest or detention in special protection centre and psychiatric facilities for two-year renewable periods without trial.  91. Pakistan referred to ongoing challenges acknowledged, and asked about specific measures being considered to ensure and enhance socio-cultural harmony among various ethnic and religious minorities.
