The review of Portugal was held at the 9th meeting, on 4 December 2009. The delegation of Portugal was headed by H.E. Mr. Pedro Lourtie, Secretary of State for European Affairs and H.E., Mr. José Conde Rodrigues, Secretary of State for Internal Affairs. At its 13th meeting, held on 8 December 2009, the Working Group adopted the present report on Portugal. 2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Portugal: Belgium, Hungary and Qatar. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were issued for the review of Portugal: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/ PRT/1 and Corr.1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/ PRT/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRT/3).  4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Portugal through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the Working Group. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The Portuguese delegation noted that the preparation of the review had been a good challenge, which had brought many opportunities for improvement in its human rights situation. 6. Portugal informed that the Government was considering a proposal to create a National Human Rights Commission. This would be a government body that would coordinate the inter-ministerial work in the field of human rights. It would significantly improve its ability to participate in exercises such as the universal periodic review, the presentation of national reports to treaty bodies, and, first and foremost, would bring clear added value to the concrete implementation of human rights. It was hoped that Portugal could formally announce its creation in March 2010 at Council. 7. Portugal further noted that this Commission would be different in nature from its national human rights institution, the Ombudsman (Provedor de Justiça), which fulfils the criteria of the Paris Principles and was accredited with “A” status since 1999. 8. Portugal noted the appointment of a Secretary of State for Equality, who will have within her priorities the fourth National Plan for Equality and Against Domestic Violence and the second National Plan against Trafficking in Human Beings. She will promote women’s entrepreneurship in the context of fighting the global economic and financial crisis. The Government will propose to Parliament the adoption of an Equality Act and a new legislation to allow same sex marriages. 9. Portugal was recognized by the United Nations in the context of the 2009 Human Development Report, as the highest ranked country in the world regarding the provision of support services and access to rights by immigrants. Portugal considered this as a tribute not only to the efforts of its public administration but also to the efforts of civil society, private companies, non-governmental organizations, and immigrants themselves with whom Portugal had been able to work in true partnership to achieve this result. 10. Portugal had deposited the instruments of ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. Portugal had also signed the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Portugal reaffirmed its deep commitment to this new human rights instrument. 11. Portugal informed that since the 2007 amendment of the Criminal Code, domestic violence had became a specific crime, punishable with 1 to 5 years of imprisonment. The prohibition of corporal punishment of children was explicitly confirmed. Two laws setting the priorities and orientations of criminal policy for the period 2007–2009 and 2009–2011 had both placed domestic violence among the priorities of criminal investigation and prevention. 12. This legal framework was completed past September with the enactment of a Law on compensation to victims of violent crimes and domestic violence and of a separate Law on the legal regime applicable to the prevention of domestic violence and to the protection and assistance to its victims, both of which were intended to prevent and repress domestic violence behaviour as well as to support and promote the autonomy and empowerment of the victims. 13. Further, other measures to fight this problem have been included in the third National Plan against Domestic Violence (2007–2010), of which more than 60 per cent had already been implemented. Special emphasis had been placed in the training of agents more directly involved with the protection and assistance of domestic violence victims, including judges and police agents.  14. Regarding the use of force by security, judicial and prison officers, including training and accountability in case of excessive use of force or other violations of human rights, Portugal informed that all officers received specific training in human rights throughout their careers. Police forces were subject to the law and to the strict respect of human rights as established in the Constitution. Accordingly, any violation of human rights would give rise to criminal liability. Police officers were also subject to their disciplinary status. All allegations of ill-treatment by any of the officers were investigated and those found responsible were punished. 15. Portugal informed that the prison system, as a whole, was not in an overcrowding situation. The current rate of occupation was 92.6 per cent. However, isolated situations of overcrowding existed, namely in the Autonomous Region of Azores. The building of two new prisons was planned to address this. The protection of the rights of children of prisoners was ensured in accordance with the principle of the best interest of the child which, in the Portuguese legislation, governs all measures and actions affecting children. Measures to provide education, training and work to prisoners have been widened in the last years with good results. In 2008 35 per cent of the prisoners attended educational programmes. 16. Portugal informed that the 2007 amendments to the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code aimed to reinforce the rights and guarantees of citizens and did not in any way collide with human rights. The preventive arrest time limits were reduced, to safeguard that no one was deprived from liberty for periods longer than the ones strictly needed for investigation or conclusion of procedures. The possibility of coercive measures alternative to preventive arrest was expanded. As for judicial secrecy, the reform aimed at reducing its scope. In what concerns possible future changes, an independent authority – the Permanent Observatory of Portuguese Justice – had monitored the amendments and its impact and a commission created by the Ministry of Justice would evaluate if further changes were needed. 17. Portugal emphasized that procedural rights were granted to all detainees within the judicial system: The defendant has, in every stage of the procedure, the right to be assisted by a lawyer. The detainee has the right to contact his lawyer immediately after detention and to communicate with him, orally or in written form, at any time during day or night. The right to the appointment of an interpreter is established in the Criminal Procedure Code.  18. Portugal recognized that a gender pay gap still persisted in the private sector. However, statistics indicated a positive trend, from 2004 to 2007, being presently 18.8 per cent. The Commission for Equality in Labour and Employment had only received 3 complaints related to gender pay gap in the period between 2006 and 2009. 19. The new Labour Code enacted in 2009 established that women were entitled to receive equal pay for equal work or work of equal value and reinforced this rule through specific regulations on the question of gender-based equality and non-discrimination. 20. Portugal underscored that Portuguese law provided for sufficient and adequate protection of the principle of non-refoulement. The system was in full compliance with the international obligation to ensure protection from torture as set out in article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  21. Portugal noted the creation of an Observatory for Trafficking in Human Beings, which produces, collects, analyses and disseminates data about trafficking and other forms of gender-based violence; the implementation of an articulated model of signalization, identification and integration of victims of trafficking, which involves all police forces and relevant non-governmental organizations; the creation of temporary shelter specific for victims of trafficking, run by an NGO with government funding; and that the National Plan’s implementation was being monitored by an independent entity who shall conduct its impact assessment. As of October 2009, there had been 231 signalled cases of trafficking, 41 confirmed cases, and 16 persons are now in support and protection centres. 22. Portugal signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 2006. Portugal expressed wish to ratify it once the independent national preventive mechanism to examine the treatment of people in detention is in place.  23. Portugal informed that its Plan of Action for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities promoted a policy of inclusion of students with permanent special educational needs in the regular educational system. Following the adoption of this Plan, legislation was approved in 2008, providing for, inter alia, the development and implementation of Individual Transition Plans, promoting the transition to post-school life and, when possible, to the labour market.  24. Portugal stated that the universal periodic review had set the stage for the most in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the national human rights situation. The need for stronger and sustained inter-ministerial coordination was a challenge that had come to the fore. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 25. During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 47 delegations. A number of delegations commended on Portugal’s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. They also appreciated the substantive and comprehensive national report, detailed presentation and the responses to advance questions.

Its mission was to promote immigrant integration and to combat all forms of discrimination based on race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin or religion through dialogue and integration process. Regarding the promotion of intercultural dialogue at the local level, attention was drawn that the national support immigrant centres and the local support immigrant offices provide information and support free of charge in an integrated way to immigrants. 54. Portugal highlighted that the phenomenon of children living on the streets had been gradually losing its expression. A non-governmental organization with public funding had specialized in providing assistance to street children focusing its activities on disadvantaged neighbourhoods. In 2008 it identified 17 children living in poverty, 10 engaged in child prostitution and supported 34 children on the run. 55. Portugal noted that there was a considerable investment in the human and financial resources for the Commission for Immigration and Gender Equality and for the promotion of gender equality. 56. Portugal noted that the Parity Law adopted in 2006 established states that any list of three or more candidates for Parliament, the European Parliament and for local authorities must ensure minimum participation of 33 per cent of each sex. The law has been fully applied for the first time to the local, national and the European elections that took place this year and produced effects in increasing the number of women elected. The Commission for Immigration and Gender Equality will launch a study to assess the degree of the implementation of law in order for the Parliament to evaluate the impact of this law in 2011. 57. Portugal had set up an action plan for immigrant integration for 2007–2009 with a holistic approach based on the participation of 13 different ministries.

These included the Integration Social Income, housing programmes, measures for social protection and school social action. Additional measures specially aimed at the integration of the Roma communities included a pilot project encompassing the creation of 15 Roma municipal mediators so that they could establish close relations with local services and organizations and local Roma communities.  59. Although the budget for the national mechanism for gender equality had been slightly reduced, the budgets for financing the initiatives of civil society, including non.governmental organizations working for gender equality and building citizenship and non.discrimination based on the grounds of sex were strongly increased for 2007–2013 (83 million Euros) 60. Portugal stated that protection of the rights of migrant workers was fundamental and such rights were already protected in the legal system. The fact that Portugal did not ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families did not hamper in any way the rights of migrants in need of protection as most of the rights were already covered by other international covenants and the European Convention of Human Rights that Portugal is a party to. Portugal emphasized that Portuguese law guaranteed the basic human rights of all migrant workers and the members of their families regardless of their status such as access to health, services and education. 61. Portugal noted that the resolution by the Parliament reinforced the national strategy for social protection and social inclusion for 2008–2010 by acknowledging the need for permanent monitoring of poverty in Portugal and for defining the poverty thresholds. 62. Portugal noted that racial discrimination was a crime and that racial hostility was also an aggravating circumstance for certain crimes and could also be taken into account in the determination of the measures of penalty. 63. Referring to the programme of action to eliminate female genital mutilation, the Russian Federation asked about the seriousness of the problem. It asked why most of Portugal’s periodic reports to treaty bodies were late and why Portugal had only replied to 4 out of 15 questionnaires sent by the Special Procedures. It noted the persistence of human trafficking, despite significant efforts to prevent it. It made a recommendation. 64. Austria welcomed legislative initiatives to overcome discrimination against women, and asked about the implementation of the action plan against domestic violence 2007– 2010. While welcoming recent reforms in the field of criminal law, Austria expressed concern on reports of ill-treatment of prisoners by security guards, enquiring about the follow-up to the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in this regard. Austria made recommendations.  65. Bosnia and Herzegovina commended on consultations made during the preparatory process, especially with civil society. It noted challenges faced by the Portuguese penitentiary system, asking whether investigations of cases of abuses and ill-treatment of prisoners had been carried out and those responsible for the abuses had been brought to justice. Concerning the racist aspects of some offences and the insufficient attention of the police and prosecutors, it asked whether Portugal considered the possibility to work on the training and capacity-building of judges, prosecutors and police staff on human rights and whether Portugal was taking appropriate steps to raise public awareness of human rights. It made a recommendation. 66. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the Government’s commitment to working towards the ratification of OP-CAT and to improving prison conditions, asking about developments in these areas. It welcomed the Plan for Integration of Immigrants and the revision of the Criminal Code in 2007. It requested further information on challenges faced to ensure the full integration of all ethnic groups.

Angola enquired about strategies to motivate and integrate children from minorities into the school system. Angola made recommendations.  70. Australia welcomed the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol and the launching of the programme of action to eliminate female genital mutilation, and the 2007 revision of the Criminal Code, which made domestic violence an “autonomous and typified crime” punishable by 1 to 5 years of imprisonment. Australia noted the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Human Rights Committee to intensify its efforts to integrate Roma communities and promote opportunities for the full enjoyment of their social, economic and cultural rights. Australia made a recommendation. 71. Ukraine welcomed efforts aimed at combating trafficking in human beings, including the 2007–2010 National Plan against Trafficking in Human Beings and the criminal investigations and punishment of the crime of trafficking. Ukraine commended on its cooperation with the civil society and welcomed the awareness-raising campaign to combat the problem of trafficking. Ukraine noted with satisfaction that Portugal’s immigration policy was coupled with an integration policy.
