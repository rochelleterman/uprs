The review of Bosnia and Herzegovina was held at the 16th meeting on 5 November 2014. The delegation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was headed by Miladin Dragi.evi., Deputy Minister for Human Rights and Refugees of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At its 18th meeting, held on 7 November 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. 2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and Sierra Leone. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Bosnia and Herzegovina: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/BIH/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/BIH/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/BIH/3). 4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Bosnia and Herzegovina through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review.  I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process  A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The delegation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, headed by Miladin Dragi.evi., Deputy Minister for Human Rights and Refugees, reported that a number of activities had been launched and carried out following the first universal periodic review. However, the country had been confronted with many economic and developmental problems which had influenced the situation of human rights. Among those problems were the extensive floods which had affected the greater part of the country. 6. The delegation referred to some of the instruments it had recently acceded to, including the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, the Council of Europe Convention on Contact concerning Children and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR). 7. The initial report to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities had been submitted and the delegation stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina had joined activities of the Council of Europe to improve the situation of persons with disabilities. The Council of Ministers had decided to establish the Council for People with Disabilities of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an advisory body in charge of monitoring the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and had initiated amendments to the relevant legislation. Bosnia and Herzegovina had ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED) in 2012 and recognized the competence of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances. The Missing Persons Institute of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been established and there were efforts under way to create a new management structure for it and a fund to provide support to the families of missing persons. 8. The delegation mentioned measures that were being taken, including expansion of the number of trained officials at the entity level and improvements to the monitoring system of discrimination at the national level through the establishment of a system for collecting data on cases of discrimination. 9. As regards child protection, the delegation referred to the action plan for children and cited several policy documents. 10. With regard to inclusive education, the delegation mentioned a number of measures related to the education of Roma children, including the provision of Roma teaching assistants in cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and a number of incentives for enrolment and attendance at school. It noted that the number of children dropping out at primary and secondary level had significantly decreased. 11. The delegation emphasized that the legal and strategic documents governing education had created the preconditions for the development of a tolerant, multi-ethnic environment in schools. 12. The delegation stated that representatives of all minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina sat on the Council for National Minorities at the State and entity levels. A strategy for Roma and a revised action plan for addressing Roma issues in the areas of employment, housing and health care had been adopted in 2013, and a budget of EUR 1.5 million created for its implementation. A strategic platform to address the issues of national minorities was also being developed. 13. On the issue of social inclusion, the delegation stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina reported regularly on the problems of vulnerable groups and proposed programmes aimed at minorities, children and women victims of violence and trafficking, which were provided through the use of additional funds from the budget and the donor programmes of a number of international organizations. Protection programmes were also undertaken with domestic NGOs. 14. In relation to the right to travel documents, the delegation stressed that citizens who fulfilled the criteria under the legislation on identity cards were entitled to travel documents and significant progress had been made in implementing the relevant regional declaration (the Zagreb Declaration). 15. The delegation noted that in the last 15 years, since trafficking had first been observed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, comprehensive measures had been undertaken to prevent it. The delegation noted that a number of indicators given in international monitoring reports were consistent in their assessment that the problem persisted, but to a much lesser extent than in previous years. The delegation mentioned the adoption of the Strategy to Counter Trafficking in Human Beings in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Action Plan 2013Ð2015. It noted that it was based on an innovative approach, involving the full participation of civil society. 16. The delegation stated that adequate psychological, medical, social and legal assistance was provided for foreigners who had been victims of trafficking, and mentioned amendments in 2010 to the criminal code of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which introduced the criminal offence of trafficking in persons, in line with relevant international standards. The delegation also provided many other details of the domestic legal framework in relation to trafficking in human beings. 17. Regarding anti-corruption and organized crime, the delegation reported that the Law on the Protection of Persons Reporting Corruption (Whistleblowers) in the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina was passed in late 2013. The anti-corruption strategy for the period 2009Ð2014 and an action plan for the implementation of strategy had been adopted and the delegation provided details of various related legislative and policy measures. 18. In relation to gender issues, the delegation stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina had signed and ratified a number of international conventions dealing with the prohibition of violence against women and domestic violence, and had harmonized national laws and facilitated their implementation. At the entity level, laws and by-laws for the prevention of and protection from domestic violence had been enacted. The new laws provided access to all levels of health care in family planning for women, regardless of the status of their health insurance. 19. The delegation mentioned that the gender action plan had specific sectorial strategies, such as the 2014Ð2017 action plan of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), the 2013Ð2017 strategy for preventing and combating domestic violence of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federation) and the 2014Ð2019 strategy for combating domestic violence of Republika Srpska. 20. The delegation also mentioned the 2014Ð2018 strategy for the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, which was in the process of being adopted. Among other measures to which the delegation referred were projects to promote the representation of women in political and public life, implemented by the Agency for Gender Equality of Bosnia and Herzegovina and entity gender centres. A womenÕs parliamentary caucus of the Federation had been established. From its inception in March 2013, the caucus parties had made a significant effort in organizational development and influence in parliament. 21. The representative of Republika Srpska recalled that the constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Dayton agreement) and was thus part of an international treaty, as well as of domestic legislation. The constitution set out the limited competencies of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and left all other competencies to the entities. Many of the issues being considered by the meeting were within the competencies of Republika Srpska. It was also important to note that the constitution included direct implementation of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 22. The representative noted that during the period under consideration, Republika Srpska had made significant progress in combating corruption, including the adoption of an action plan and strategy and the formation of an expert group for the monitoring of their implementation. 23. In relation to combating trafficking in human beings, the representative mentioned the important step that had been taken through the harmonization of the criminal code of Republika Srpska with international standards relating to the definition of trafficking. Republika Srpska had also taken measures to implement the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in relation to sentenced prisoners. Conditions of detention had been improved and any abuse of authority or use of excessive force or inhuman treatment by police officers was strictly punished. 24. The representative stated that the criminal code of Republika Srpska provided sanctions against incitement of national, racial or religious hatred, discord or intolerance. 25. Republika Srpska had been active in judicial reform, but the representative noted that many judicial institutions had been created in the post-war period in contravention of the constitution. It was necessary to eliminate ethnic discrimination in the work of the ProsecutorÕs Office and Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in processing cases of war crimes committed against Serbs. 26. The representative of Republika Srpska expressed the hope that the new Government, which would be constituted after the recent general elections, would support all reasonable proposals for the implementation of the decision in the case of Sejdi. and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Republika Srpska had already proposed a way to eliminate all discriminatory election provisions on its territory. The representative also noted that in the case of Maktouf and Damjanovi. v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Court of Human Rights had proposed that the practice of retroactive application of the law in war crimes cases be eliminated, but that the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina had not yet adopted measures to implement this. 27. In relation to the equality of all ethnic minorities, the representative of Republika Srpska noted that none of the entityÕs laws contained discriminatory provisions in that respect. Members of the Roma community enjoyed the same rights as other citizens, including health care. Republika Srpska had undertaken numerous measures to advance the status of women, including in combating violence against women, their political participation and employment. Notably, the criminal code had been amended to treat domestic violence as a crime rather than a misdemeanour. Republika Srpska had adopted a strategy on combating domestic violence, a related law and protocols, and had also formed the Council for Children. 28. The representative of the Federation noted that its Government was conscious of the existence of discrimination in certain fields within the entity and was clear in condemning all acts of discrimination. A series of legal measures had been introduced to address the issue, but the entity Government had spoken boldly in favour of constitutional reform, the need to simplify and reduce the structures of governance and against discrimination on any basis. The support of friendly countries was necessary to enable citizens to enjoy the same rights as those in the most developed countries. He noted that, while the entities did have certain competencies, they did not have international legal personality and the statements of the representative of Republika Srpska, which went outside the existing constitutional framework, underlined the need for constitutional reform, which would assist democracy and the fulfilment of the international obligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 29. The representative of the Federation stated that education in the entity was within the competency of its cantons and the Federal Ministry had only a coordinating role. However, the Ministry of Education and the Government of the Federation had invested much effort and adopted a strategy and recommendations for the elimination of divided structures and segregation in schools, commonly known as Òtwo schools under one roofÓ. Those were preconditions for the creation of a multi-ethnic and tolerant environment in schools in the Federation. The representative also highlighted the investment and efforts needed to improve conditions for children with special needs. 30. In relation to employment rights the Government of the Federation was unswervingly committed to respecting the fulfilment of the rights and obligations of both employees and employers. A new modern labour law was being drafted. The Federation regretted the length of some judicial proceedings in labour-related cases. Tackling the informal economy was another priority for the Government of the Federation: new laws on misdemeanours and labour inspection had been adopted to increase employee protection, with increased inspections and penalties. 31. The representative noted that the Government of the Federation fully understood the significance and gravity of the problems caused by corruption and had consequently initiated several major reform processes. The general plan on combating corruption and two related laws were probably the most important recent reforms. Specialized courts and prosecutorsÕ offices were important elements of those. 32. Significant progress had been made in improving the conditions of detention and the representative mentioned that the legislation had been amended. Particularly important were the provisions for the serving of sentences under home detention orders and for substituting the payment of financial compensation for imprisonment. Those provisions had greatly relieved overcrowding. 33. The representative noted that the damage caused during the recent floods had amounted to billions of euros and the Government of the Federation had undertaken great efforts to help the affected citizens to return to normal life, with a particular emphasis on ensuring the equitable distribution of assistance. 34. The representative highlighted the cooperation of the Federation with the Office of the High Representative and international organizations, such as the International Commission for Missing Persons and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and thanked them for the assistance of those and numerous other domestic and international institutions. The Government of the Federation remained united in its support for human rights as an overarching priority and would continue to apply itself to full implementation of the accepted international instruments.  B.

In relation to the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, he noted that 99 per cent of their housing had been returned to them since the end of the war, but problems in ensuring sustainability had contributed to a slow rate of return. Moreover, the living conditions for many of those that had returned were not yet satisfactory.

The Bosnia and Herzegovina and entity Governments had adopted plans and activities, in cooperation with the NGOs, with the aim of ensuring support for victims of domestic violence. 68. A draft action plan for human rights and related directives in the field of human rights had been prepared and the Assistant Minister also noted that there was legislation in place to protect persons of various sexual orientations. The Ministry was seeking to improve practices in that area. Both the Council for Children and the Council for Persons with Disabilities had continued their work. 69.

Bosnia and Herzegovina had made progress with regard to the rights of persons with disabilities, but would re-examine issues raised in the interactive dialogue. 70. The representative of the Ministry of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina noted the importance of the case of Sejdi. and Finci. Although the issue had not been resolved, Bosnia and Herzegovina had taken some measures for enforcing the decision of the court, including the creation of a commission, which was to prepare the draft constitutional and legislative amendments.
