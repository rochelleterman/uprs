Presentation by the State under review 5. At the 16th meeting, the delegation of Belarus, headed by the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Permanent Representative of Belarus to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations at Geneva, Mikhail Khvostov, began its presentation of the national report. It expressed its view that the universal periodic review process had successfully fulfilled its purpose of ensuring the objective review of the human rights situation in all countries. According to the delegation, consultations had been held with a maximum number of interested actors, including civil society, during the preparation of the national report. The delegation stressed that it had no intention of ignoring the challenges and shortcomings in the protection and promotion of human rights, while noting that the pace and conditions of the development and capabilities of Governments differed. 6. The delegation noted that Belarus had managed to accomplish a series of achievements under difficult conditions, including, inter alia, the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in 1986, and that those achievements were a basis for confidence that human rights in Belarus were in the process of sustainable development. 7. The delegation referred to the United Nations Human Development Report 2009, according to which Belarus ranked 68th in the human development index and was included in the group of countries with high human development. As noted by the delegation, Belarus had implemented the Millennium Development Goals related to poverty eradication, equality between men and women, and access to primary education prior to the deadline. 8. According to the delegation, the literacy rate of the Belarusian population was among the highest in the world, standing at 99.7 per cent for adults and 99.8 per cent for minors. 9. The delegation stated that the country’s unemployment rate was the lowest in Eastern Europe. Belarus had the second highest gross domestic product per capita in the Commonwealth of Independent States and one of the lowest poverty rates in the world. Approximately 85.4 per cent of State support was allocated to the needs of the social sector, which was the highest level in the region. The delegation referred to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which ranked Belarus 44th in terms of expenditure on health and education, quality of education and adult literacy, life expectancy, good governance, level of corruption, sanitation and clean water supply. It noted that Belarus was among the world leaders in overcoming economic inequalities. 10. The delegation highlighted the fact that Belarus was party to nearly all core human rights instruments of the United Nations. The Constitution recognized the universally recognized principles of international law and ensured that the country’s legislation was consistent with them. According to the delegation, universally recognized human rights standards were reflected in the relevant national legislation, including, inter alia, laws on political parties, voluntary organizations and trade unions, national minorities, and religious organizations.  11. As noted by the delegation, the President, as the guarantor of the Constitution and of human rights and freedoms, adopted measures to defend and implement citizens’ rights by issuing laws and deciding on specific issues, coordinating action on human rights with the three branches of Government. It also noted that the National Assembly (Parliament) adopted laws, established legal mechanisms, ensured the observance and protection of citizens’ rights and freedoms, and had a Standing Commission for Human Rights. 12. The delegation stated that a network of specialized State-public institutions, including, inter alia, the National Commission on the Rights of the Child, the National Council on Gender Policy and the Inter-Ethnic Advisory Council, operated in the country to promote and protect various categories of human rights.  13. The delegation noted that the Act on Citizens’ Appeals obliged Government bodies and officials to adopt the measures necessary to restore citizens’ rights that had been violated and to oversee their implementation. In 2009, a total of 40,000 appeals had been submitted by citizens on issues involving human rights and policies. 14. According to the delegation, there were currently 2,200 non-governmental organizations and 15 political parties. Belarus had an effective and independent judiciary; it noted that this was an important factor for human rights protection. 15. The delegation referred to the data of both the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to which Belarusian women enjoyed a high level of civil liberties, and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, according to which Belarus ranked 19th in the world in terms of the level of representation of women in Parliament. It stated that 36 women’s organizations operated in the country. According to the delegation, women held 19.3 per cent of senior positions in State bodies and 46.4 per cent of judgeships.  16. As noted by the delegation, Belarus devoted special attention to ensuring opportunities for children’s self-expression, and there were 23 children’s organizations and 141 youth associations receiving financial support from the State. The number of adoptions by foreigners had decreased, and 72.7 per cent of orphans were under alternative forms of guardianship. 17. At the United Nations, the President had launched the initiative to intensify international efforts to combat human trafficking, as a result of which a global plan of action was expected to be adopted at the United Nations. Owing to effective measures, the number of crimes involving human trafficking had decreased. Belarus had established an International Training Centre on Migration and Combating Human Trafficking.  18. According to the delegation, people from more than 130 ethnic groups lived in Belarus, and conflicts on ethnic, racial, cultural, linguistic or religious grounds had traditionally been non-existent. There were 123 voluntary organizations representing ethnic and cultural communities that received financial support from the Government. Persons belonging to a number of ethnic groups studied their mother tongue in educational institutions.  Newspapers were published, and radio and television programmes were broadcast, in Polish, Ukrainian and Lithuanian.  19. The delegation mentioned the increase in the number of religious communities from 765 to 3,262 and the increase in the number of religious denominations from 8 to 25. Registered religious organizations were exempt from taxes and received State assistance for the restoration of religious buildings. 20. The delegation highlighted the active cooperation of Belarus with international organizations.  Belarus had taken measures for the implementation of recommendations made by the special procedures mandate holders on freedom of expression and opinion; an independent judiciary and lawyers; the trafficking in persons, especially women and children; and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which had visited Belarus. Furthermore, Belarus had sent invitations to eight special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council to visit the country. Belarus had also actively cooperated with treaty-based bodies and had submitted its periodic reports to five of those bodies in 2009. At the initiative of Belarus, representatives of OHCHR had visited the country in 2009 to discuss possible assistance or support for Belarus in protecting and promoting human rights. The delegation noted that the implementation of a joint project to strengthen human rights capacities had been planned. B.

It made recommendations. 53. With regard to the death penalty, the delegation explained that the issue of its abolition was very sensitive. When a universal referendum had been held on the issue in 1996, more than 80 per cent of the population had voted in favour of retaining this form of punishment. The Constitution and the Penal Code set out the temporary and exclusive nature of the application of the death penalty, as provided for in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The delegation noted that the death penalty was applied extremely rarely and that the law regulated the procedure for amnesty for those sentenced to death.  54. The delegation noted that Belarus understood and respected the position of countries asking for the abolition of the death sentence, and that it was indeed considering ways and means to achieve its abolition. A parliamentary working group had been established for that purpose. Efforts had also been made to influence public opinion through the mass media and awareness-raising campaigns. However, a decision to abolish the death penalty or adopt a moratorium could not be taken without bearing in mind the outcome of the referendum. A decision should be made in full awareness and should be irrevocable.  Belarus would continue its cooperation with the international community on this matter. In that regard, Belarus recalled that it had not voted against the General Assembly resolutions promoting a moratorium. 55. With regard to the right to engage in peaceful demonstration, Belarus provided the assurance that it was guaranteed by law as long as demonstrations did not violate public order or the rights of other citizens.  Public security and order had to be maintained in the conduct of demonstrations. The procedures established by law were designed to ensure the realization of the freedoms of citizens as well as public security. The delegation noted that this was entirely consistent with its international obligations, including those under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  56. Concerning the question of torture, Belarus noted that it was party to the Convention against Torture.  In order to ensure criminal responsibility for acts of torture, the definition set out in article 1 of the Convention was fully applied. The Penal Code described all such acts as serious crimes punishable by 3 to 10 years of imprisonment, in addition to a provision prohibiting perpetrators from holding public posts. Persons subjected to torture could submit complaints to the prosecutor’s office or the judiciary, which had to respond to such complaints without delay, and the law also provided for means of public oversight. 57. According to the delegation, Belarus also devoted special attention to the issue of human detention conditions. No person could be detained other than on the basis of law, all detentions had to respect human dignity, and all cruel or degrading treatment was prohibited. The Government had allocated considerable resources to the improvement of correctional institutions. 58. The delegation noted that its legislation on freedom of association was based on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Political parties and public organizations could freely pursue their activities in accordance with their statutes and programmes. The elimination of political parties or public organizations for political reasons was prohibited by law.  The laws on political parties and on public organizations set out the requirements and procedures for their establishment, and the requirements were of a uniform nature and did not depend on the nature of the activities pursued by the organization concerned. There was also an easily accessible appeals mechanism. 59. The delegation stated that, while some of the requirements for the establishment of associations might appear rigid, they were justified in practice.  Belarus was one of the few countries in which the activities of non-governmental organizations did not include extremism, xenophobia or religious or racial hatred.  The delegation noted that there was a favourable environment for the activities of such organizations. More than 2,200 public associations and 15 political parties were registered. According to the delegation, the number of associations was constantly rising. 60. The delegation noted that a similar situation prevailed with regard to trade union activity. Belarus had been a member of the International Labour Organization since 1954 and had ratified 49 of its conventions.  61. Belarus stated that the monopolization of the media by the State or by private individuals or entities was prohibited. According to the delegation, the State did not regulate Internet media. Equal economic conditions existed for the development of all media, irrespective of their ownership. The 2009 Law on Mass Media had established the legal mechanisms for independent professional media activity and simplified the procedure for establishing media.    62. The delegation noted that its legislation enshrined and ensured the conduct of elections in accordance with the international treaties to which it was a party. Thus, Belarus followed the generally recognized standards for the preparation and conduct of elections, although there were, unfortunately, no universal criteria by which to evaluate the democratic nature of elections. According to the delegation, the law on elections was being constantly improved, and the Electoral Code had recently been amended to extend the rights of participants in election campaigns as well as those of observers.  Belarus followed the principle that elections should be observed, and elections in Belarus were monitored not only by a large number of national observers, but also by foreign observers, including representatives of international organizations.   63. Nicaragua emphasized that Belarus had developed a democratic State and had attained the poverty eradication objective set out in the Millennium Declaration. Nicaragua made recommendations.   64. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya noted that Belarus had brought its national legislation into line with human rights instruments. Libya praised the introduction of human rights education in primary schools and similar awareness-raising measures. Libya made recommendations. 65. Oman noted the commitment of Belarus to human rights protection, as demonstrated by its achievements in eradicating poverty and reducing unemployment rates and maternal and child mortality rates, as well as achievements in education and other areas. Oman made recommendations.  66. Bangladesh noted that the economic success of Belarus had led to a steady reduction in poverty, helped to foster the enjoyment of human rights and made progress in the health sector. It noted the significant efforts made in combating human trafficking, and its commitment to engage constructively with the United Nations human rights mechanisms. Bangladesh made recommendations. 67. Spain thanked Belarus for the presentation of its national report and made recommendations.   68. Uzbekistan noted that Belarus was implementing measures to protect human rights. It observed that Belarus had transposed their provision in its national legislation. Uzbekistan commended efforts in the areas of health and education and in combating human trafficking. Uzbekistan made recommendations. 69. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted that Belarus had extended constructive cooperation to the international human rights machinery. It highlighted achievements regarding most of the Millennium Development Goals, including those related to poverty eradication, illiteracy and infant and maternal mortality. Iran made recommendations. 70. Indonesia commended Belarus for its measures to ensure the right to education and achieve a high literacy rate. It referred to the country’s attention to the educational needs of disabled children and of non-Belarus nationals, and noted the increasing acknowledgement of the role of civil society. It made a recommendation.  71. Iraq sought clarification regarding the programme on human trafficking and illegal migration for the period 2008-2010, inquiring whether the Government intended to extend it. Iraq urged Belarus to cooperate with the Human Rights Council with regard to the special procedures.  Iraq made a recommendation. 72. Tajikistan stated that Belarus had worked consistently to extend mechanisms for safeguarding, in particular, the right of citizens to work and the right to social security, together with the rights of children and women and the right to education, including human rights education. It asked about the country’s efforts to combat human trafficking. Tajikistan made recommendations. 73. Ireland welcomed the establishment of the European Union-Belarus Human Rights Dialogue and the introduction of a plan for gender equality. It asked questions about human rights defenders and the law on mass events. It expressed concern about reports concerning the arbitrary application of registration standards, the harassment and closure of non.governmental organizations, the right to freedom of association, and the continuing difficulties faced by independent newspapers in being registered. It made recommendations. 74. The Syrian Arab Republic referred to the efforts of Belarus to find a compromise among realizing individual rights, heeding the interests of society and maintaining a balance in protecting human rights. It noted the country’s democratic progress. It made recommendations. 75. Canada expressed concern about the deteriorating human rights situation, in particular the lack of free and fair elections, the curtailment of political freedoms, the intimidation of political opponents, State control over media and restrictions on independent media, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly. Canada made recommendations. 76. Netherlands commended Belarus for its efforts to combat the trafficking in persons. It referred to the country’s application of the death penalty and expressed concern about its procedures for appeals in such cases and about reports of the continued harassment, intimidation and arbitrary arrest of human rights defenders, politically active individuals and journalists. It made recommendations.  77. The Czech Republic referred to the issue of the death penalty. It raised the issues of protection against torture and the protection of human rights defenders. It requested Belarus to elaborate on its measures to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. It made recommendations. 78. Belgium remained concerned about the situation of human rights, despite a number of positive developments since 2008. It regretted the fact that Belarus was the only European State to apply the death penalty, and that the 2009 Act on the mass media unduly restricted freedom of the media. It also stated that civil society faced a series of unjustified obstacles compromising freedom of association. Belgium made recommendations. 79. Nepal referred to the efforts of Belarus in socio-economic and political development and in ensuring the rule of law and social justice. It highlighted the Act on Citizen Appeals as innovative and commended the country’s efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of eradicating poverty and its constructive cooperation with the international human rights mechanisms. 80. Djibouti noted the openness of Belarus with certain mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, which attested to its commitment to build a society based on social justice and respectful of democracy. It stated that the building of a democratic State respectful of rights was a dynamic and gradual process involving the implementation of all human rights. Djibouti made recommendations. 81. Poland expressed concern at the complicated procedure for registering civic organizations, political parties and unions and that the law allowed for the possibility of arbitrary rejection. It referred to the Criminal Code, which provided for deprivation of freedom for up to two years for participating in the activities of an unregistered civic or religious association or party. It made recommendations.  82. Finland expressed concern about the issues of capital punishment and the situation of the Roma community. It asked questions about those issues and made recommendations.  83. Turkey stated that it was pleased by the good record of Belarus in terms of access to health and the right to education. It supported efforts to combat human trafficking and welcomed the modernization of the penal corrections system. It also encouraged the authorities to continue efforts to implement the revised electoral system in order to address shortcomings. 84. France asked whether Belarus would abolish the death penalty. It asked about measures taken to continue investigating allegations of enforced disappearance, as planned in 2009, pursuant to the recommendations of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. France made recommendations. 85. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea noted the efforts of Belarus to strengthen its constitutional, legal, political and economic guarantees. It commended the country’s efforts in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, including the increased expenditure for education, which had led to the high literacy rate; the advanced health-care system; and growth in per capita income. It made recommendations.  86. With respect to the issue of human trafficking, the delegation noted that Belarus, as a party to all international instruments aimed at combating modern forms of slavery, had made the consideration of measures against the trafficking in human beings a priority of Government policy. 87. The delegation stated that, since 2002, Belarus had been implementing a comprehensive Government programme to combat the trafficking in persons. Eighteen criminal organizations, including 15 international ones, and 64 criminal gangs had been eliminated. The Government, together with international organizations and national public associations, had put in place a scheme for the rehabilitation and social reintegration of trafficking victims.   88. As noted by the delegation, in 2009, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in women and children, had visited Belarus and commended its efforts to combat the trafficking in human beings at the national and international levels. The Government continued to devote attention to the further improvement of legislation and new laws, including the Law on Combating Trafficking, which was slated for adoption in 2010.  89. Regarding the protection of persons with disabilities, the delegation mentioned the Law on Social Protection of Persons with Disabilities and the implementation of State programmes on the environment without limitations for persons with disabilities. Owing to measures carried out by the Government, the employment rate for persons with disabilities had risen from 25 per cent in 1995 to 45 per cent in 2008. 90. Concerning the protection of children’s rights, the delegation noted that Belarus had developed a system for providing material support to families and children, and that the budget financed 40 per cent of the costs of children’s meals in nursery schools and of care, medical and psychological monitoring services.  91. As noted by the Government, equal access to education for every child, regardless of his or her health condition and learning capability, was a priority for the Government. Belarus devoted special attention to orphans and children without parental care, thus providing additional social guarantees for them. Special attention was devoted to combating violence against children in unfavourable family conditions, and a mechanism had been put in place for the timely provision of assistance to children in socially vulnerable situations and in need. 92. According to the delegation, Belarus had developed a concept on juvenile justice that envisaged the establishment of special courts to hear administrative, criminal and civil cases involving children. 93. The delegation noted that the Government made systematic efforts to ensure that Roma citizens had access to social and medical services, employment and education, that their children attended school and that they were issued with passports and participated in the country’s social and cultural life. 94. Concerning the implementation of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the delegation explained that Belarus was not a member of the Council.
