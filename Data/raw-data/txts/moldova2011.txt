At its 18th meeting, held on 14 October 2011, the Working Group adopted the report on the Republic of Moldova. 2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Republic of Moldova: Hungary, Kyrgyzstan and Mauritius. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were issued for the review of the Republic of Moldova:  (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/MDA/1);   (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/MDA/2);  (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/MDA/3).  4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to the Republic of Moldova through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR.  I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process  A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The delegation expressed the Government.s commitment to the universal periodic review process. It stated that the process of the preparation of the national report, which included the national human rights institutions and stakeholders, gave the country an opportunity to assess the human rights situation and would allow creating synergies between human rights policies and the lives of people. 6. The Republic of Moldova had extended a standing invitation to all mandate holders for special procedures. It had been continuously improving the normative and institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights in accordance with the international standards, national priorities and aspirations of the European integration. Furthermore, the international legal instruments were directly applicable in the national legal system. The Government had undertaken measures to ensure respect of all human rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed to its citizens and in particular, it supported the existence of a strong, free and independent civil society, including the media. 7. Since the formation of the Government two years ago, new initiatives to implement  the country.s international human rights obligations had been undertaken. In particular, the European Union (EU)-Moldova dialogue on human rights had been launched and the Moldovan experts together with the regional organizations had been discussing the priorities for cooperation in the area of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and democracy. The delegation explained that the perspective of the European integration had created a positive environment for the modernization and transformation, with significant achievements in the field of human rights. The criminal code and laws on peaceful assembly, access to legal assistance, domestic violence, human trafficking, juvenile justice and social assistance had each been improved. 8. However, a number of challenges and events, including post-election events in April 2009, tested the national capacities in human rights and supported new proactive approaches, especially in improving the implementation of legal norms in this area.  9. The delegation stated that as human rights were recognized a priority issue, a number of policies and programmes were adopted to enhance the human rights protection. The National Human Rights Action Plans of the Republic of Moldova for the period of 2011-2014 which represented the continuity of the previous national action plan included a mid-term evaluation of the document to be in line with UPR recommendations. 10. The draft law on preventing and combating discrimination was developed in order to strengthen existing rules and create mechanisms for the implementation of the principles of non-discrimination and equality. The draft law included, inter alia, an indicative list of criteria of discrimination and established a council for preventing and combating discrimination.  However, as the consultations over the draft law revealed certain sensitivities within the society, the draft was withdrawn from the Parliament for further consideration. Following this, the Government embarked on a path of broad consultations aimed inter alia at ensuring that the law would be endorsed not only by the Government, but also by the entire society. Recently, the draft anti-discrimination law was submitted to the public authorities and civil society for coordination and comments before adopting this legislative act. 11. The delegation reported that in March 2011 the Ministry of Justice registered the Islamic League of the Republic of Moldova as a religious organization, enabling the organization to enjoy the full range of benefits deriving from its legal personality. At the same time, extensive consultations with the participation of the civil society and religious organizations were launched in order to start the amendment procedure of the existing law on the religious organizations. The country visit of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief in September, made a positive contribution to this end. 12. The delegation reported on the Strategy for Justice Sector Reform for 2011-2016 which created the institutional framework necessary to coordinate reform in this area and to build an accessible, efficient, independent, transparent and professional justice sector. The importance of the justice sector reform was also reflected in the new Development Strategy ÒMoldova 2020Ó. The delegation also noted the recently adopted Action Plan to support the Roma population for 2011-2015, which contained measures affecting  key areas of social life. 13. A working group on amending the Ombudsman Law was established to bring the existing regulations in compliance with Paris Principles. The Centre for Human Rights of Moldova was accredited in 2009 with B status according to the Paris Principles. 14. The delegation noted the recent reform of the prison system which had the following major objectives: improving the legal criminal-executive framework, improving conditions of detention in accordance with international standards, increasing transparency in detention institutions and preventing torture and cases of ill-treatment, and building capacity of prison staff.  15. The delegation informed that the Republic of Moldova would start the ratification process of the Protocol 12 to the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms after the adoption of the legal framework on anti-discrimination. With regard to the (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issue, the delegation noted that homosexuality was no longer criminalized in the domestic legislation. However, the LGBT issue remained a sensitive topic with important cultural and religious implications and thus, a gradual approach, one that would strike a fair balance between the rights of all citizens and the particularities of the society would be adopted. 16. Human rights in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova represent a priority for the Government. Specialized ministries and institutions continued to follow up on the developments in the human rights field in the Eastern districts and provided with assistance to the population within their competences and possibilities. The current situation in the region created serious obstacles and difficulties in the enforcement of human rights throughout the country. The delegation noted that addressing human rights issues in this region did not rest exclusively with the Government and it should be part of discussions with the international partners involved in the settlement process.  B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 17. During the interactive dialogue, 37 delegations made statements. A number of countries welcomed the open and constructive participation of the Republic of Moldova in the universal periodic review.

Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 18. Algeria noted that the institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights had been constantly improved. It welcomed the inclusion of Muslim religion into the national register of religious beliefs and inquired about the follow-up to the recommendation made by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief regarding the formulation of a law against discrimination and investment in civic education. Algeria made recommendations. 19. Thailand commended the Republic of Moldova for its commitment to protecting human rights, especially in the areas of anti-discrimination, rights of minorities and human rights education through ÒCivic EducationÓ.

The Russian Federation stated that poverty, unemployment and the absence of social protection for vulnerable groups of the population were a reality in the Republic of Moldova. Of special concern were the restrictions on the rights of ethnic minorities to use their mother tongue. The authorities were attempting to limit the use of the Russian language in all spheres of life. Over the last two years, a number of schools teaching Russian were closed and Russian studies were removed from higher education. The Russian Federation made recommendations. 24.

Qatar stated that the Republic of Moldova.s Constitution gave priority to human rights and that human rights were at the heart of public policy.

Norway made recommendations.  32. Australia commended the Republic of Moldova for the efforts to increase public awareness of domestic violence and the instructions given to public and law enforcement officials on addressing this problem, but expressed concern that the legal remedies for domestic violence were limited to fines and brief detentions. It welcomed the improvement in prison conditions the reduction of time of pretrial detentions and stated that prisons and pretrial facilities fell short of international standards.

Greece made recommendations.  34. Italy stated that it would continue to support the ongoing process of reform in the Republic of Moldova and the strengthening of its relations with the European Union. Italy noted that domestic violence against women was a serious problem. The lack of proper facilities hampered access to education for children with disabilities, leading to their limited participation in social life. Italy welcomed Moldova.s ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its strategy for social inclusion for 2010-2013. Italy made recommendations.  35. Germany expressed concern about the allegations of torture and ill-treatment in police custody.

Uruguay made recommendations.  43.

Regarding the questions on the issue of effectiveness and transparency of judiciary, the delegation stated that while being fully aware of the challenges in this area, the Government had initiated the relevant measures to address those challenges by, inter alia, the adoption of the strategy of reform of the judiciary. The plan of action had been in the process of the development based on the Strategy which would assist to adopt and improve relevant laws in line with the European and international standards. 56. In respect to questions on the human rights violations during the events of April 2009, the delegation informed that about half of the complaints submitted to the Prosecutor office by the victims had been under the investigation and 27 cases were already referred to the judiciary. The court judgements were issued in respect to two cases. As to the eight  judgements rendered by the European Court of Human Rights regarding human rights violations of the April events, the Government had provided with compensations to the victims. 57. In the context of implementation of the prison reform, the Government was in the process of identifying solutions for building adequate detention facilities. In particular, a new prison would be built to replace prison No. 13 in Chisinau as a main priority. In this respect, the Government appealed to the Council of Europe Development Bank to secure the relevant funding.  A number of other initiatives had been also launched to improve conditions in prisons, including renovation of sanitary facilities and medical units as well as the section of juvenile detainees in the prison No. 13. 58. In respect to the questions on human trafficking, the delegation reported that the number of identified victims had reportedly decreased greatly compared to 2007.  Moldova was no longer a major source country for human trafficking. Nevertheless, the Government continued to intensify its counter-trafficking programmes. The National Referral System with a nationwide coverage included multi-disciplinary professional education for law enforcement officials, social and medical personnel. It was based on the "active prevention" approach and become a best practice in the region.  59. The Government had launched a programme to provide life-skills training to children in institutions who were considered to be more vulnerable to human trafficking.  A new monitoring mechanism over the activities of law enforcement agencies and judiciary was in the process of formation to improve the prosecution and punishment of trafficking. The delegation informed about the invitation extended to the Special Rapporteur on human trafficking to visit the country. 60. The Ministry of Education launched a programme, ÒFriendly schools for allÓ, in 2010, with a view to creating an environment favourable for the development of mutual respect and tolerance and free from violence and all forms of discriminations on the grounds of sex, ethnicity or health status.  In 2011, the Government also approved the programme on inclusive education with the objective of creating conditions for the inclusion of children who had not been in public school system as well as those studying in regular schools but in need of special education.  61. As shaping the existing traditions was required along with the development of legal framework to address the issue of child labour, the Government approved the National Plan for Combating the Child Labour and Exploitation to inter alia raise public awareness on the issue of child labour. The Government had also adopted the National Strategy to reform the residential care system and increased the State funding for this purpose. The number of children in the institutions had decreased by 40 per cent.  At the same time, a large number of children remained without parental care as a result of migration of the population abroad in a search for jobs. To this end, the Government had started a nationwide study to assess and address the needs of such children. 62. To address a question on the status and use of the Russian language, the delegation stated that the legal framework, and specifically the law regarding the functioning of spoken languages on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, required the creation of the necessary conditions to guarantee access to education in Russian, Gagauz, Ukrainian, Bulgarian and other languages. Students were entitled with the right to choose the language of instruction at any level of education. Furthermore, the Russian language was legally recognized as a language of interethnic communication. There was a mandatory subject on Russian language and literature in the schools with education in the Romanian language. Domestic legislation and official communications were available in the Russian language. Every citizen had a right to request and to receive information from the public authorities in the State language or Russian. 63. Regarding to the issue of schools with education in Russian, the delegation reported that there were 280 Russian-language schools functioning nationwide. The information about the closure of 60 Russian schools in the past two years was incorrect.  In the past years, only 14 of the 70 educational institutions which were reorganized or simply merged with others, were Russian-language schools. The delegation suggested that the decrease in the number of such schools should be explained keeping in mind the general demographic trend of the population and restructuring of the education system.  64. The delegation reported on a number of steps undertaken by the Government to ensure gender equality in line with the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, including training conducted for the gender focal points of all State agencies, the inclusion of special chapters on gender equality in the State Programme and Action Plan, and gender mainstreaming in the draft development strategy ãMoldova 2020.. It also mentioned that a recommendation on temporary special measures was initiated before the Parliament to introduce a 30 per cent quota in the election of the members of the Parliament. 65. Regarding the issue of domestic violence, the Government had co-sponsored several shelters for victims countrywide. The National Bureau of Statistics adopted a special module to its periodic surveys to track in official data incidence, frequency and profile of domestic violence. Additionally, Moldova, in 2010 recognized domestic violence as a criminal offence. The relevant legal provisions provided a definition and a mechanism for the enforcement including the mechanism for the protection orders. In less than two years,  about 200 protection orders were enforced in respect to cases of domestic violence. 66. As the human rights situation in the Transnistrian region had been a source of serious concern, the Government had been monitoring the violations of human rights in the region. In this respect, the Government had regularly raised the cases of human rights violations before the relevant international actors and also sought for the cooperation with the representatives of the civil society and mass media in order to improve the human rights situation in the region. 67. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in cooperation with line ministries, had launched internal consultations on the issue of lifting territorial reservations under the international treaties on human rights. At the same time, the fact that the Transnistrian region had been outside the control of the constitutional authorities of the Republic of Moldova made it extremely difficult to ensure proper respect of fundamental human rights and freedoms in the region. The Government offered, to the extent of its possibilities, assistance to persons whose rights were violated.  68. The delegation mentioned a number of specific human rights issues that the region faced: the status of Latin-script schools remained undefined and those schools encountered difficulties in their day-to-day operation, and the obstacles created for free movement of people and goods between the region and the rest of the country in spite of the requirements of international agreements and other decisions regulating the situation in the conflict zone. The delegation stated that the current leadership of the region did not provide positive response or solutions to the issues raised by the Government. 69. The delegation indicated that human rights activists and international organizations working in the human rights field in the region had been operating in a hostile environment and under permanent surveillance and pressure from the Transnistrian security services. With an interest in the development of civil society in the region, the delegation urged the international partners to contribute to the achievement of civil society development in Transnistrian region despite of existing difficulties.  70. The delegation noted the Government.s efforts undertaken to promote the economic, social, and cultural and education polices in the region. The Government had also created legal mechanisms to guarantee the respect of the constitutional rights of its citizens such as property rights, free access to justice on the region. Furthermore, the Government had been striving to achieve a lasting political solution through negotiations with the final goal of granting a special legal status to the Transnistrian region within the Republic of Moldova based on the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The final resolution of the conflict should pave the way for building democratic institutions and development of a genuine civil society in the region, as well as the implementation of all international human rights commitments undertaken by the Republic of Moldova. 71. The delegation reported on the increased number of visits to detention places carried out by the national preventive mechanism in the past years. According to the draft 2012 budget, the national preventive mechanism would receive 25 percent more funding than last year, which in turn would allow the mechanism to increase the number of visits to the detention places. 72. In conclusion, the delegation stated that the universal periodic review had enabled the Government to compare its assessment of human rights situation with the views of other United Nations Member States and relevant stakeholders. It reaffirmed the Government.s commitment to continue its engagement with civil society in the upcoming months while considering further recommendations put forward during the interactive dialogue.   II.
