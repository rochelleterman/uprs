The review of Lesotho was held at the 6th meeting, on 5 May 2010. The delegation of Lesotho was headed by the Honourable (Mrs.) Mpeo Mahase-Moiloa, Minister of Justice, Human Rights and the Correctional Service and of Law and Constitutional Affairs of the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho. At its 10th meeting, held on 7 May 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on Lesotho. 2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Lesotho: Cameroon, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were issued for the review of Lesotho: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/LSO/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/LSO/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/LSO/3).  4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Lesotho through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The delegation of Lesotho introduced its national report and stated that the country had undergone a similar process under the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) in July 2009. Lesotho’s national report to the universal periodic review had been prepared through an integrated institutional process and in consultation with civil society. 6. The delegation noted that Lesotho was one of the least developed countries and one of the countries with the lowest official development assistance per capita. The global financial and economic crises had had devastating socio-economic effects. Despite the adverse affects, Lesotho had made major strides towards the full enjoyment of human rights.  7. The delegation noted that national reports on domestic implementation had been submitted on ICCPR in 1999, on ICERD in 2000 and on CRC in 2001. There were currently draft reports on ICESCR and a periodic report on ICCPR, and every effort would be made to submit the report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women before the end of 2010. 8. When examining Lesotho, the Human Rights Committee had made recommendations on some provisions of the Constitution that were not compatible with the Covenant. In response, Lesotho had enacted laws such as the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act 2006, which ruled out discrimination against women in marriage, and the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which addressed areas under the common law offence of rape. The Committee had also commented on the need to improve conditions of prisons, and the delegation had stated that conditions were being improved through renovations.  9. The Committee on the Rights of the Child had recommended that the Children’s Protection Act 1980 be brought into conformity with the principles of CRC. Consequently, a comprehensive children’s protection and welfare bill had recently been forwarded to Parliament.   10. The delegation noted that CERD had been concerned by the absence of a comprehensive legislative framework prohibiting acts of racial discrimination and by the lack of effective remedies. The Race Relations Order 1971 had then been amended to include provisions for the teaching of tolerance and peaceful coexistence among people of diverse origins. 11. The delegation indicated that, in an attempt to make Parliament more responsive to the needs of the population, some reform measures had been introduced, and it now had portfolio committees that monitored ministries and facilitated people’s participation in law making, policy formulation and the fielding of proposals.  12. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is empowered to conduct free and fair elections and referendums. The delegation highlighted the fact that the IEC was independent and that it had organized the first National Assembly elections in 1998 and subsequent elections in 2002 and 2007. The delegation noted that all had been declared free and fair by domestic, regional and international observers. 13. The Office of the Ombudsman complemented the work of the judiciary as a constitutional body, mandated to investigate all allegations involving acts perpetrated by Government agencies. The enforcement of the Ombudsman’s recommendations was overseen by Parliament and was working well.  14. The delegation noted that Lesotho retained the death penalty solely for the following offences: murder, treason and rape. However, there were appropriate safeguards. Capital punishment had not been carried out since 1995, and most sentences had been commuted to terms of life or long imprisonment. 15. Lesotho noted that it had witnessed an increase in human trafficking involving women and children, and that plans were under way to establish a legislative framework for addressing this. 16. The delegation indicated that Lesotho’s achievements included high literacy rates and the adoption of the Mixed Member Proportional Representation Electoral Model. The Government had also taken steps to empower women politically; hence, the Local Government Act in 2004 had been amended to allocate 30 per cent of the seats in the Local Councils to women, and 58 per cent representation of women had actually been achieved. 17. Regarding the HIV/AIDS pandemic, various efforts have been undertaken, including voluntary counselling and testing and the establishment of the National Aids Commission. An HIV/AIDS Bill is under preparation and will provide a legal framework for interventions. Despite resource limitations, the poor are afforded free access to available health services.  18. Lesotho continues to be beset by a decline in agricultural production as a result of soil erosion and periodic droughts. As a result, the country is experiencing a worsening food deficit and widening poverty and food insecurity. Despite those setbacks and negative effects, the Government continues to prioritize social safety nets, such as school feeding and orphaned and vulnerable children’s programmes and old-age pension schemes. 19. The delegation stated that the already high levels of unemployment had been exacerbated by the global crises. The economy was in dire straits, and economic and social rights would be seriously threatened unless the international community should provide additional support. Despite challenges, Lesotho remained committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the Vision 2020 Strategic Framework. 20. In response to advance questions, Lesotho stated that it had maintained the death penalty under statutory law as a form of deterrence; the penalty had not been carried out for the past 15 years. The Government took note of the international trend towards the abolition of the death penalty. Freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment was guaranteed under the Constitution and was prohibited under applicable common law; and, in 2000, Lesotho had ratified the Convention against Torture. It provided information about the Police Complaints Authority and the Office of the Ombudsman, established to address allegations of torture in places of detention. The ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture would be considered.  21. Concerning places of detention, conditions have been improved considerably following the renovation of certain institutions in some districts, including the Mental Institution for Inmates, which is currently under construction. Nonetheless, there is still a need for infrastructural improvements, resources permitting.   22. The delegation noted that Lesotho adhered to the right to freely participate in public processions and gatherings, as well as to freedom of expression, in as much as Lesotho had the duty to ensure the security of the people. Through the enactment of the Public Processions and Meetings Bill, Lesotho was seeking to strike a balance between those two obligations.  23. The delegation stated that in Lesotho, freedom of press flourished and there were about 10 privately owned radio stations and newspapers, all of which enjoyed free broadcasting and publishing. Independent bodies such as the Lesotho Telecommunications Authority, the Media Institute of Lesotho and others regulated media issues. The draft media policy upheld the right of freedom of expression.   24. The delegation stated that the Children’s Protection and Welfare Bill, inspired by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, would be discussed during the current sitting of Parliament. The Government had put in place Child and Gender Protection Units at all police posts to respond to allegations of violence against children. A toll-free child help line for reporting abuse was also in place.  25. As the plight of HIV and AIDS had led to more children being orphaned, the Government provided payment of school fees, monthly grants and food packages to such orphans. 26. Concerning the protection of children in conflict with the law, the Government had enacted the Children’s Protection Act 1980. Rather than employing usual criminal justice procedures, the country had adopted the use of restorative justice. The Children’s Protection and Welfare Bill had further improved the child justice system.   27. The Constitution established the age of majority at 18. Lesotho was working on various pieces of legislation to bring them into conformity with the Constitution and international standards. 28. The delegation noted that, despite the existing reservation to article 2 of CEDAW, Lesotho had undertaken measures to ensure the elimination of discrimination against women, as well as gender equality, by undertaking a review of all discriminatory laws.  The Child and Gender Protection Unit actively addressed issues related to gender-based violence.  29. The delegation referred to a study to assess the prevalence and impact of domestic violence, the outcome of which would be used to inform the enactment of legislation on domestic violence. 30. The delegation stated that it was necessary to proceed cautiously, beginning with sensitizing the public in order to pave the way for the establishment of a Human Rights Commission, and that the relevant draft legislation was already in place.   31. Lesotho was overdue in submitting some reports under certain human rights instruments owing to, inter alia, limited capacity. However, measures were being taken to address the situation.  32. Regarding an invitation to special procedure mandate holders, the delegation noted that Lesotho had already resorted to that function under APRM and found it to be quite adequate, and that duplication of efforts should be avoided. 33. The delegation indicated that the 2007 general election had never been subject to dispute. What had been disputed was the allocation of proportional representation seats. These were allocated by an independent body, IEC. Parties had agreed to amend relevant electoral laws in preparation for the 2012 general elections, while dialogue continued on the allocation of proportional representation seats and other outstanding issues. 34. The delegation concluded by indicating Lesotho’s ambition to move forward expeditiously towards best practice in the field of human rights. The pace was determined by the availability of the requisite resources and capacity, as well as the receptiveness of society. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 35. During the interactive dialogue, 48 delegations made statements. Recommendations made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report.  36. A number of delegations thanked Lesotho for its cooperation with the universal periodic review mechanism and commended the delegation for the consultative process for the preparation of the national report, as well as for the comprehensive presentation.  37. Nicaragua recognized Lesotho’s implementation of its strategic framework, Vision 2020.

It noted the fact that free primary education had been introduced in 2000, the implementation of the programme “Education for All” and Lesotho’s unique position in sub-Saharan Africa, with an enrolment rate of 84 per cent for 2006. It highlighted the efforts to establish mandatory primary education and to promote amendments to the Law of Education. It made recommendations.  40. Cuba highlighted the strategies of Lesotho concerning the fight against poverty; the modification of the law of racial relations, which provided for protection from racial hate; and the 2008 law on the environment. It also highlighted advances in protecting the rights of peoples with disabilities, women and children, ensuring access to health and education and guaranteeing the right to food. It highlighted the National Plan of Food Security and strategies to improve agricultural productivity. It made recommendations. 41. Brazil noted the increase in the representation of women in political positions. The persistence of female genital mutilation was of particular concern, and it expressed concern about allegations of excessive control of the media. It asked in which areas the international community could better assist in controlling and combating the spread of HIV/AIDS. It asked what measures were being undertaken to guarantee that social, economic and cultural rights received the same treatment as civil and political rights under the Constitution. Brazil made recommendations.  42. Belarus noted that Lesotho needed international assistance to resolve the problems it faced with respect to the AIDS/HIV pandemic and poverty, and to ensure capacity-building for human rights protection. It congratulated Lesotho on its support for UNICEF and the European Commission in its effort to help categories of children, including orphans. It welcomed the drafting of a bill on the protection and well-being of children, considered as a priority by the Government. Belarus made recommendations. 43. Algeria referred to the technical assistance requested by Lesotho with respect to its periodic reports and the setting up of a national human rights commission.

Algeria noted that improving the functioning of justice was one of the national priorities.

It urged taking advantage of the international focus to rally support for a comprehensive law to combat the trafficking in persons. It commended efforts to professionalize the police and to guard against impunity.

The United States made recommendations.  45. Argentina recognized the establishment of the Ministry of Gender Affairs and the Unit for the Protection of Women and Children, and the focus on positive discrimination adopted at the level of local government. It asked about legislation on the age of majority, as well as women’s civil rights. It made recommendations. 46. Egypt commended the efforts made in the fight against poverty, including the poverty reduction strategy paper and National Vision 2020, based on the three principles of democracy, good governance and human rights. It hailed efforts undertaken to provide quality health services, in addition to compulsory free primary education, and for the achievement of food security. It welcomed in particular the adoption of the Children’s Protection Act of 1980. However, it stated that such efforts were hampered by the lack of capacity and resources. Egypt made recommendations.  47. Germany appreciated the fact that the interests of the child remained one of the top priorities in the Government’s policies and programmes. On the other hand, the Committee on the Rights of the Child had raised serious concerns about incidents of violence against children committed by law enforcement officials and the lack of investigation or criminal justice response to such incidents. Another serious issue was the indications of a high number of sexual abuses against women. It asked which measures the Government had taken or would take to strengthen the awareness of children’s rights issues within the criminal justice system. Germany made recommendations. 48. Norway noted the progress reported on gender equality, but remained concerned about, inter alia, the persistence of discrimination based on customary law.

It welcomed the fact that there had been no execution of capital punishment sentences since 1995, and it also welcomed the promotion of gender equality and women’s rights. It made recommendations. 58. Australia looked forward to the establishment of the Human Rights Commission. Although executions had not been carried out since 1995, it regretted the fact that Lesotho had not formally abolished the death penalty. While noting progress in women’s rights, Australia expressed concern about ongoing gender discrimination, violence against women and unequal access to employment. It noted with concern reports of violence against and the sexual exploitation of children, as well as child labour. It remained troubled by ongoing discrimination against homosexuals and the criminalization of male homosexuality.

Senegal also noted that Lesotho had established a number of institutions tasked with protecting and promoting human rights, stressing human rights education, and it welcomed this spirit. Senegal made recommendations. 62. In response, the delegation of Lesotho thanked the States for their questions. The head of delegation stated that, to the best of her knowledge, Lesotho did not practice female genital mutilation. Concerning food insecurity, the Government was doing its best to invest resources in an agricultural project, “block farming”, assisting farmers in increasing food production. With support from donor partners, Lesotho would be able to deal with the issue of food insecurity to some degree. 63. With regard to addressing the issue of social, economic and cultural rights on an equal footing with that of civil and political rights, the delegation indicated that this would depend on, inter alia, economic strength, and that it was making progress. In considering education and health policies, Lesotho was making an effort to ensure that those rights were enjoyed.  64. With regard to reporting under human rights instruments, Lesotho was indeed engaged in consultations with OHCHR for technical assistance to ensure that the country complied with reporting obligations. The delegation considered that Lesotho would be able to accomplish this shortly.  65. Concerning the establishment of the Human Rights Commission, the delegation referred to the technical assistance of UNDP, through which Lesotho had prepared a draft piece of legislation. Challenges included establishing appropriate infrastructure and assigning commissioners, given Lesotho’s limited resources. Lesotho was raising public awareness, which would pave the way for the draft bill to be tabled before Parliament. 66. With respect to the human rights situation during the political unrest, such as that in 2007, as had been pointed out, the delegation stated that the Government insisted on the rule of law. Aggrieved citizens had the right to resort to legal means, the courts, the ombudsman and the police complaints mechanism, and the delegation emphasized that all reported cases, even those against law enforcement officials, would be investigated and, where necessary, brought before courts of law.  67. The delegation stated that the Children’s Protection and Welfare Bill had been read out before Parliament on 5 May 2010 and that there was confidence that, given the preparations, it would shortly be adopted. Financial resources were a major challenge to the implementation of the Bill, as it provided for the introduction of institutions to be built. Child labour and other social and welfare issues were included in the Bill. 68. Concerning HIV/AIDS, the delegation indicated that Lesotho had a policy and was drafting a bill that would be taken to Parliament in order to address issues concerning infected persons, including children and all groups affected by the pandemic.  69. As regards the death penalty, the delegation of Lesotho stated that it continued to exist as it was confined to three capital crimes and that, beyond that point, the courts always adopted a very restrictive approach. Even when the death penalty was imposed, the Pardons Committee would recommend that the head of State exercise his prerogative of mercy in commuting it to life imprisonment. The delegation stated that, in reality, capital punishment did not exist in Lesotho, although it remained in the statute book. 70. The delegation stated that as regards local government elections, which were supposed to be held in 2010, there was an agreement with all stakeholders to delay this election in order to clarify and straighten out certain issues as regards the local councils. On the issue of freedom of expression, it is enshrined in the constitution. While exercising it towards other people, the prescribed limitations on such cases will be decided by the courts. 71. The delegation stated that it was taken aback by the questions regarding the independence of the judiciary, as Lesotho was proud of its independent and free judiciary, which drew inspiration from the Constitution. The Government availed itself of all resources at its disposal to protect and enhance the independence of the judiciary.  72. As regards children and justice, Lesotho remained ready to support the rights of children, as it regarded them as the future. Lesotho was working tirelessly to reform the justice sector and to be more sensitive in its treatment of children who had come into contact with the law. It had developed units within the police service to care for such children and conducted related training programmes for judges, prosecutors and magistrates. Lesotho, with the assistance of the United Nations, was carrying out sustained sensitization programmes to provide care for children in contact with the justice system, in compliance with the relevant United Nations guidelines.  73. Slovenia commended achievements in the area of gender equality, including the high percentage of women in Parliament. Despite progress, it expressed concern about reported discrimination against women, permitted under customary and common law. Slovenia was pleased to know that the draft Children’s Protection and Welfare Bill was before Parliament. It expressed concern about the reported use of children for the production and trafficking of drugs, and referred to recommendation of the ILO Committee of Experts. Slovenia made recommendations. 74. Spain highlighted the measures promoting gender equality and the protection of children’s rights through the establishment of the Dependency of Protection of Women and Children in 2002 in the police force, as well as the Gender Department in the Ministry of Women. It made recommendations. 75. Hungary noted with concern that the impact of HIV/AIDS had adversely affected the effective realization of human rights in general and the human rights set out in CRC and CEDAW in particular. Hungary urged Lesotho to fully implement the principle of non.discrimination regarding girls and women by improving, inter alia, their access to education and health. Referring to overdue national treaty body reports, it stressed that, while technical assistance might be necessary, it should not be a substitute for States’ primary responsibility in terms of protecting and promoting human rights. Hungary made recommendations.  76. Slovakia highlighted a report indicating rising levels of gender-based violence. It welcomed the establishment of the Department of Gender, providing, inter alia, an outreach centre for abused women and children, and the setting up of the Child and Gender Protection Unit and the Victims of Crime Support Office. It stated that the minimum age of criminal responsibility, currently 7 years, was very low. It referred to a 2007 report indicating a high incidence of the sexual abuse of children. Slovakia made recommendations.  77. Italy expressed concern at the persistence of customary practices in contrast with the rights of women and the widespread phenomenon of violence against women and girls, including domestic and sexual violence. It welcomed the de facto moratorium on the death penalty, in place since 1995. It noted that legislation did not fully reflect the principles and provisions of CRC, including the minimum age for criminal responsibility. It made recommendations. 78. Singapore referred to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Lesotho as one of the highest in the world. It welcomed the draft bill on children’s protection and welfare, currently being discussed in Parliament. It acknowledged Lesotho’s success in promoting a gender perspective, including through the establishment of the Ministry of Gender and the development of a Gender Policy and a Unit for Gender and Child Protection. 79. The Sudan welcomed Lesotho’s accession to a number of human rights instruments and protocols. The national report reflected the efforts made to protect the family, combat crime, alleviate poverty and improve school curriculums as well as the well-being of youth. It commended the emphasis placed on education and noted that the literacy rate had reached 84.4 per cent. It noted that Lesotho suffered from the phenomenon of female genital mutilation, referring to the increasing numbers of people infected with HIV/AIDS, in particular young people. The Sudan made a recommendation. 80. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya noted that initiatives such as Vision 2020, the poverty reduction strategy paper and the Vision and Strategy for the Justice Sector would enhance progress in the economic, social and political areas, as well as human development. It highlighted legislation and policies concerning the protection and well-being of children. It noted Lesotho’s problems in the area of child labour and the commercial exploitation of children, and asked about its implementation of the programme to eliminate child labour. It made recommendations.  81. Mozambique noted that Lesotho had ratified at least 13 international and regional legal instruments, including ICCPR, ICESCR, CERD and CRC. It noted the policy to promote the rights of the people with disabilities, enacted five years previous, and encouraged the Government to proceed vigorously with programmes aimed at containing and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The practice of commuting the death penalty to life sentences was one to be continued. 82. Nepal noted that the Office of the Ombudsman was empowered to investigate any malpractice in administrative offices, while the Police Complaints Authority investigated alleged human rights violations by police personnel. Nepal was pleased to note that a Human Rights Unit had been established within the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Correctional Service, and it welcomed the plan to establish a national human rights commission. It commended efforts to promote gender parity and noted the success achieved in ensuring high representation of women at various levels of government. Nepal made a recommendation. 83. Chad congratulated Lesotho on the clear presentation of its national report. It noted with satisfaction that Lesotho was a party to most of the core human rights instruments, whether regional or international. Chad made recommendations. 84. Burkina Faso encouraged Lesotho to continue its efforts to strengthen and improve the situation, suggesting that it request the support of the relevant international bodies, particularly for technical assistance and capacity-building, as indicated in its national report, inter alia; to submit the national reports under the instruments to which Lesotho was a party; to improve the effectiveness of its legal system; and to bring its efforts into line with the Paris Principles. Burkina Faso inquired about the strategies planned to apply the fundamental precepts of human rights in rural areas in order to assist the population in achieving the necessary balance between customary law and constitutional and international principles. 85. Zimbabwe commended Lesotho for its national report, which was the product of inclusive stakeholder consultations. It noted that Lesotho was committed to human rights and saluted its achievements. As a member of the region, it recognized Lesotho’s challenges, noting that they were not insurmountable. It made recommendations. 86. Botswana commended Lesotho for its measures to guarantee Basotho the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular through National Vision 2020, the Justice Sector Vision and Strategy, and the National Youth Policy. It highlighted Lesotho’s strides in promoting women’s rights. It welcomed the fact that Lesotho was candid regarding its challenges, such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the effects of the economic and financial crisis, which threatened, inter alia, to undermine its social safety net mechanisms. It made recommendations. 87. South Africa noted the challenges faced by Lesotho as a least developed country, which had been compounded by the recent crises.
