Presentation by the State under review 5. At the first meeting, on 3 May 2010, the delegation of Kyrgyzstan, headed by the Deputy Minister of Justice, Mrs. Jyldyz Mambetalieva, began its presentation with information about the situation in the country following the political events of April 2010. Because of the situation that has developed since 7 April, the provisional Government assumed power and took on functions entrusted to the President and the parliament of Kyrgyzstan. The delegation stated that, at the time of reporting, all State institutions were performing their functions in all their capacities and that the provisional Government, headed by Mrs. Rosa Otunbaeva, had full control over the situation in the country. 6. As stated by the delegation, because of the April events, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have closed their borders. The provisional Government has, however, taken the steps necessary to address that issue, as the opening of the border could not only positively affect the country’s social and economic situation, but also ease the tension in Kyrgyzstan. 7. The delegation cited the three priorities of the provisional Government: restoring law and order in the country, resolving socio-economic problems and restoring the legitimacy of the Government through democratic reform and democratic processes. The aim of the provisional Government, as explained by the delegation, was to return the country to democratic governance and the rule of law and to overcome cronyism and tribalism in the public administration system. Promoting a nationwide discussion on the draft constitution, holding a referendum for its adoption and conducting free and fair parliamentary and presidential elections were cited as the short-term objectives of the provisional Government. 8. With respect to the national report, the delegation stated that a number of public events had been organized, including seminars and consultative meetings with civil society and international organizations in the preparation of the national report for the universal periodic review. The report presented the main legal framework for the human rights mechanism. As noted by the delegation, the April events in Kyrgyzstan demonstrated that the human rights practices of the State did not meet the requirements and needs of the people. Despite the political changes, the delegation took part in the Working Group session with a view to an open and constructive dialogue, confident that an objective assessment of the national report and the recommendations of States would serve the promotion and protection of human rights in Kyrgyzstan. 9. The provisional Government, committed to ensuring human rights and freedoms, has taken several measures to that end. These have included supporting the release of political figures and public leaders from their places of detention, including those who had been illegally detained and charged with organizing mass disturbances on the eve of the presidential elections in 2009. As noted by the delegation, the provisional Government has placed priority on the issue of an independent judiciary, planned to pursue a policy aimed at protecting the rights of refugees, and expressed its commitment to freedom of expression, planning to introduce public broadcasting. The ratification by Parliament in March 2010 of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is noteworthy.  10. The delegation noted that protecting children’s interests remained a priority for the country and that the relevant domestic legislation reflected the norms set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child aimed at the more effective protection of children’s rights. The delegation noted that State orphanages remained the main form of support for neglected children and that more than 88 per cent of children in orphanages had been separated from their families because of difficult economic situations. Local centres had been established to support children and families as a part of a decentralized system for the protection of children and families. The delegation expressed the need to further develop the capacities of existing institutions and of United Nations technical assistance. Kyrgyzstan planned to establish a juvenile justice system and believed it necessary to adopt a plan of action regarding the issues of the trafficking in children, child pornography and prostitution.  11. While referring to a number of measures that had been taken to ensure the participation of women in public administration, the delegation recognized the need to strengthen the strategy aimed at eliminating stereotypes regarding the role of women and men in society and the family. The delegation also referred to the problem of violence and bride-kidnapping, which had persisted despite a number of criminal prosecutions; expressed its readiness to take further measures to improve the situation, including awareness-raising measures; and cited the need to develop national projects and relevant technical assistance. 12. The delegation referred to a number of measures taken to ensure the rights of ethnic minorities, including the provision of education in four languages. The delegation also noted its plans to develop and implement a policy that took into account the ethnic and cultural diversity of its society. The delegation expressed the adherence of Kyrgyzstan to the principles of tolerance and mutual respect among various ethnicities and religions. 13. While referring to the decrease in the number of imprisoned persons since 2007, the delegation expressed its intention to further develop alternative forms of punishment for juvenile offenders and adults by continuing initiated reforms in the penitentiary system, and acknowledged the need to improve the conditions of detention of convicted persons. The delegation expressed the commitment of Kyrgyzstan to the implementation of its international obligations and its support for the activities of international organizations.  B.

It made recommendations. 19. Kuwait acknowledged the efforts made to eradicate terrorism and referred to the law of 8 November 2006, which placed priority on respect for human rights and the protection of people exposed to dangers resulting from terrorist acts. It welcomed constitutional measures to protect children’s rights stipulating that parents had the primary responsibility for their children’s education and that the State was responsible for the protection of orphans. Kuwait made recommendations. 20. Algeria welcomed the presentation of the report despite the difficult situation. It expressed hope for the rapid restoration of constitutional order, the restoration of stability, respect for human rights, and the achievement of socio-economic development. It requested further information about recent legislation regarding the relationship between international and national laws, as well as the role of the Office of the Mediator. Algeria made recommendations.  21. Norway expressed regret at the recent loss of life and underlined the importance of an early return to public order under a democratic Government that fully respected human rights. It welcomed moves towards constitutional reform and democratic elections. Norway 1 Bhutan, the Sudan and Morocco. expressed concern about the vulnerable situation of human rights defenders, journalists and lawyers. Norway made recommendations. 22. Brazil believed that the universal periodic review could contribute to the efforts to achieve democratization, strengthen the judiciary, reduce poverty, pursue sustainable development and guarantee freedom of expression.  It highlighted the abolition of the death penalty.  It inquired about steps taken to protect children and women, combat discrimination and the shortcomings regarding economic, social and cultural rights. Brazil made recommendations. 23. Turkey underscored the importance of fair and timely elections in upholding the rule of law and welcomed the announcement of the upcoming constitutional referendum and parliamentary elections. Turkey encouraged Kyrgyzstan to accede to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to consider the establishment of an independent national human rights institution. 24. Indonesia hoped for the swift restoration of national stability. It noted the ratification of the “New Generation” programme on children’s rights. It highlighted the fact that the Constitution provided for gender equality and noted the substantial increase in the number of women in Government positions. It asked for further information about the Act on social and legal protection against domestic violence and human trafficking. 25. Kazakhstan welcomed the will of the Kyrgyz people to live in a free and democratic society.  It noted the new challenges relating to the stabilization of the political situation and the enhancement of economic development.  It stated that it believed that the provisional Government was aware of the concerns of the international community, and expressed the hope that the Government would cooperate with it.  Kazakhstan made recommendations. 26. Kyrgyzstan noted that, since 2009, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Migration had assumed the function of coordinating the efforts of central and local governments aimed at the implementation of the State gender policy. As one of the objectives of the national strategy on gender equality 2007-2010 was to combat all forms of violence against women, amendments to the legislation on domestic violence, |based on the results of the monitoring of the implementation of the domestic violence legislation, had been drafted and submitted to parliament. In March 2010, the campaign against domestic violence had been officially launched in Kyrgyzstan, in cooperation with the United Nations. Polygamy and bride-kidnapping constituted crimes under the Criminal Code. The delegation also noted the draft amendments to national legislation aimed at strengthening punishments for human trafficking and associated crimes and at protecting the victims of trafficking. 27. With regard to freedom of expression, the delegation noted that the investigation of a number of cases involving violence against journalists remained a priority for the law enforcement bodies. Since 2005, 34 cases of violence against journalists had been recorded and 28 criminal cases had been launched. In that respect, through a decision by the Ministry of the Interior, a special investigative group had been established to investigate cases of violence against journalists and to bring the perpetrators to justice.  28. Kyrgyzstan noted that a large number of print and broadcast media were registered in the country. However, journalists faced serious problems in performing their functions, as there had been a number of cases in the past involving beatings and other forms of violence directed against journalists, including threats to their lives. The previous authorities had established control over media through re-registration mechanisms, and any criticism expressed in the media had resulted in the closure of the media outlet concerned. The Ombudsman had established a special division on the protection of civil and political rights, and was in the process of developing a national human rights action plan that would include protection of the rights of journalists. The Office of the Ombudsman had also been monitoring the implementation of the Law on Media and planned to report the results to parliament. 29. Germany encouraged Kyrgyzstan to enhance respect for human rights and international law. It asked how the Government intended to promote civil society, particularly human rights defenders; how it would ensure that civil rights would be strengthened through the constitutional reforms; and whether it intended to change the Law on Religion in order to guarantee freedom of religion. Germany made recommendations. 30. India noted the accession by Kyrgyzstan to most human rights instruments. It welcomed the establishment of institutional mechanisms to protect children rights.

It made a recommendation. 32. The Russian Federation acknowledged the steps that Kyrgyzstan had taken since its independence to establish the legal foundations for human rights and democracy.  It noted the challenges ahead. It mentioned the high levels of poverty as one reason for political instability.  It hoped for rapid normalization, through a return to the rule of law, the adoption of a new constitution and the holding of elections.  33. France recognized the Government’s commitment to re-establishing legality, holding transparent elections and guaranteeing human rights protection.

Concerning questions about the 2009 elections, Kyrgyzstan noted that, under its laws, access to the Electoral Commission was open, relevant stakeholders as well as the media were able to attend its meetings, and its decisions were published in the media. Kyrgyzstan explained that an automated system had been established for voter registration and for the provision of information about the electoral process.  The provisional Government would establish a commission in order to ensure a transparent electoral process, with full participation on the part of civil society and the political parties. 52. With regard to the judiciary, Kyrgyzstan noted that, since its independence, a comprehensive judicial system had been established and that interference with the judiciary was prohibited by the Constitution. However, further measures would need to be taken to strengthen the judiciary and its independence. The first step taken by the provisional Government had been aimed at the reform of the Constitutional Court. This would be followed by measures to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. 53. Regarding the issue of children’s rights, Kyrgyzstan rejected the view that corporal punishment was permitted in Kyrgyzstan, noting that corporal punishment and the infliction of physical or moral suffering on children was prohibited by law.  Accordingly, cases of violence against children were duly investigated and prosecuted. A system of juvenile justice was in the process of being established, and special measures had been taken to assist children in conflict with the law.  A draft law on juvenile justice, as well as amendments to other relevant legislation, had been formulated by a special working group. In addition, a major study on domestic violence had been carried out in 2009 together with UNICEF.  The study would serve as the basis for the formulation of additional amendments to laws, as well as plans of action to eradicate violence against children.  There were also plans to seek alternatives to detaining children in conflict with the law; these included programmes in special schools, such as rehabilitation programmes and therapy, as well as active work with families.  As part of a pilot project, further work would be carried out with the aim of reforming major institutions that provide services to children in crisis.  Standards for foster family services were set out in the Children’s Code.  The best interests of the child would always be at the centre of the measures undertaken.  54. With regard to the right to peaceful assembly, it was noted that all citizens had that right as long as they did not carry firearms.  However, a law adopted on that right in 2008 was considered not to be in accordance with international standards. Accordingly, efforts were under way to formulate a new law. A working group had been established for this purpose; it worked in conjunction with the Ombudsman and independent experts.  A new draft law had already been reviewed by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions.  In that context, it was noted that the Office of the Ombudsman required additional administrative support from the international community in order to strengthen its capacity to review draft legislation. 55. The delegation further stated that the provisional Government had embarked on measures to address past violations of rights for political reasons.  A number of individual cases had been reviewed, including in connection with the suppression of civil unrest in 2008, which had involved arbitrary detention and the violation of due-process rights, in addition to the reported use of torture.  Past investigations carried out by the Ministry of Interior had been characterized by irregularities, including political pressure on investigators.  Political opponents who had been arrested, often as a reprisal measure, had now been acquitted. 56. Malaysia regretted the casualties resulting from the recent unrest. It acknowledged Kyrgyzstan’s commitment to fulfilling its human rights obligations, noting the adoption of the National Human Rights Programme for 2002-2010 and the Agenda for National Renewal in 2009. Malaysia encouraged Kyrgyzstan to, inter alia, increase efforts to bring its national legislation into line with relevant international human rights instruments. Malaysia made recommendations. 57. Austria expressed concern about the loss of life and the continuing instability. The re-establishment of public order, respect for the rule of law and human rights were of the utmost importance. Austria welcomed the commitment of the provisional Government to ensuring respect for international human rights obligations. Austria welcomed the announcement regarding the pursuit of constitutional reform and the preparations for democratic elections. Austria made recommendations. 58. Armenia acknowledged the planned steps to establish the rule of law and promote human rights. Armenia expressed its readiness to support Kyrgyzstan’s efforts to build a future-oriented society whose members would fully enjoy the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Armenia made recommendations. 59. Netherlands regretted the loss of life and welcomed the fact that elections were planned to be held soon.

The Netherlands made recommendations. 60. The Czech Republic acknowledged that, in 2008, Kyrgyzstan had become a State party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT). It made recommendations.  61. Argentina noted the legal reforms aimed at achieving equality between men and women and at guaranteeing a minimum of 30 per cent representation of women in local and national bodies.  Argentina made recommendations. 62. Lebanon hoped that the participation of the provisional Government in the review would contribute to the improvement of the human rights situation and to the fulfilment of the aspirations of the Kyrgyz people. Lebanon made recommendations. 63. Belgium underscored that it was important that the process of ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights be concluded successfully. Belgium called attention to concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination regarding asylum seekers belonging to certain minority groups. It expressed concern about domestic violence. Belgium made recommendations. 64. The Islamic Republic of Iran appreciated the fact that the Government had participated in the universal periodic review despite recent developments.

It highlighted achievements in the areas of education, the rights of women and children, and the right to life and health. Iran made recommendations.  65. Denmark encouraged the provisional Government to ensure respect and protection for all human rights and to provide for free, fair and transparent democratic elections. It asked about measures to protect journalists and human rights defenders. Denmark noted that child labour remained a growing challenge, citing reports of widespread torture and other forms of ill treatment. Denmark made recommendations. 66. Slovakia expressed appreciation for the abolition of the death penalty in Kyrgyzstan in 2007 and the country’s planned accession to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The delegation recognized the commendable normative framework in place concerning children. However, it expressed concern about the persistence of child labour in the country. Slovakia made recommendations. 67. Sweden requested further elaboration about measures taken to protect freedom of expression, including the protection of the security of journalists.  It also mentioned the issue of the corporal punishment of children and inquired about measures taken to ensure the freedom of children from violence, including corporal punishment, in any setting. Sweden made recommendations.  68. Uruguay welcomed the efforts made by Kyrgyzstan to abolish the death penalty and to incorporate that prohibition into its Constitution. Uruguay also welcomed the opening of the OHCHR office for Central Asia in the country.

Japan made a recommendation. 70. Ireland appreciated the abolition of the death penalty. It remained concerned about a number of issues, in particular de facto discrimination against women and widespread domestic violence; the independence of the judiciary; and the increasing attacks against journalists and obstacles to the right to peaceful assembly.

It made a recommendation. 72. Latvia called on Kyrgyzstan to abide by all its international obligations and commitments and to ensure an early return to the constitutional order, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
