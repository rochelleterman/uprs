Presentation by the State under review 5. The delegation said that the national report was prepared through a broad consultative process involving all relevant government departments, established national human rights institutions and a range of NGOs active in the field of human rights. 6. Strong and independent institutions exist to guarantee the rights of the citizens, such as the National Human Rights Commission (which includes the Sex Discrimination Division), the Ombudsman and the Ombudsperson for Children. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has had accreditation “Status A” since 2002. 7. In consonance with the treaties and conventions to which Mauritius is a party, a number of legislative measures have been adopted recently to further promote human rights, such as the HIV and AIDS Act 2006, the Certificate of Morality Act 2006, the Imprisonment for Civil Debt (Abolition) Act 2006, the Borrower Protection Act 2007 and the Truth and Justice Commission Act 2008 8. Mauritius has also recently adopted the Equal Opportunities Act 2008 which provides for an Equal Opportunities Division within the NHRC and an Equal Opportunities Tribunal to enforce the provisions of the Act. 9. To advance the realization of economic, social and cultural rights for its citizens with a view to combating poverty, the Government has placed empowerment and the reduction of poverty programmes at the heart of the economic programme launched in 2006 to restructure the Mauritian economy. It has also established a Fund with the aim of doubling enrolment in tertiary education institutions by 2015. With a view to fostering a culture of human rights in the country, it has set up a Human Rights Centre that is responsible for promoting human rights education among citizens. Mauritius is, at present, finalizing a National Action Plan on Human Rights which seeks to develop a strong culture of human rights in Mauritius. 10. In line with the Government Programme for 2005-2010, the enforcement mechanism of the Protection from Domestic Violence Act has been strengthened. The Government is also in the process of finalizing a Combating of Trafficking in Persons Bill. 11. The Government approved the National Gender Policy and National Plan of Action in April 2005. It has also developed a National Gender Policy Framework which provides broad guidelines for the implementation of gender-mainstreaming strategies. 12. The Government Policy Paper and Plan of Action on Disability contains a series of measures relating to, inter alia, health, education, training, employment, human rights, and accessibility. An Implementation and Monitoring Committee has been set up to work on the implementation of the recommendations of the Plan of Action for early ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). 13. The HIV and AIDS Act aims at ensuring that all persons living with HIV/AIDS are treated in fairness and respect. HIV/AIDS is not treated as a disability and any discriminatory behaviour towards people living with HIV/AIDS is punishable by law. 14. The death penalty was abolished in Mauritius in 1995 with the passage of the Abolition of Death Penalty Act. Mandatory sentences, including mandatory life sentences, have been ruled to be unconstitutional and are being reviewed on a case-to-case basis. 15. Answering the advance questions, the delegation stated that Mauritius would welcome the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council and is considering whether to issue a standing invitation to all Special Procedures. A decision in this regard will be taken shortly. 16. As for the question on measures available to protect the rights of detainees' children and registration procedures available to ascertain caring responsibilities of detainees, the delegation said that the law provides that the infant children of female detainees may be taken care of in a reform institution at public expense until the age of five. The children will be provided with health care and specialized medical care, when required, and may attend a pre-primary school in the community as from the age of 3. Social aid may, if required, be provided to the child. If the child is left without parental supervision, he or she is referred to the Child Development Unit of the Ministry of Women’s Rights, Child Development and Family Welfare. 17. With respect to the human rights training provided to law enforcement and judicial officers with regard to the protection of human rights of women, children and persons of minority sexual orientation or gender identity, the delegation replied that the Police and Prisons Departments offer training and refresher courses on human rights and other subjects. It is expected that the Equal Opportunities Division of the NHRC, once set up, will conduct educational and other programmes to eliminate discrimination on grounds of status, including sexual orientation. Relevant technical assistance from other States or organizations would be appreciated. 18. The inclusion of economic, social and cultural rights in the Constitution, as recommended by the NHRC, would be considered soon. 19. Responding to the question about the impartiality of disciplinary action against police officers, the delegation said that the Disciplined Forces Services Commission exercises disciplinary control over police officers and discharges its functions independently and impartially. The forthcoming establishment of a police complaints authority will also ensure that disciplinary action is taken in appropriate cases. 20. Steps are being taken to modernize investigation methods within the police force to decrease reliance on the use of confessions. The Prime Minister’s Office is considering the introduction of appropriate legislation, a better system of complaint-processing and a system of earned remission for all prisoners. The forthcoming statutory establishment of a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) in line with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OP-CAT) will also help address the detention conditions of prisoners. 21. The prosecution of sex offenders is being expedited. Consideration will be given to establishing dedicated sex offence units within the police and Forensic Science Laboratory with a view to lodging such cases, where prosecution is justified, within two to four months of the commission of the offence. The Government would welcome assistance from other States with regard to training local persons who will be responsible for providing psychological treatment to sex offenders. The report of the Select Committee on the Sexual Offences Bill is currently being finalized. The Select Committee is expected to make recommendations concerning marital rape and sexual relations between consenting adults. 22. The Constitution and main laws will soon be available in Creole. In addition, laws are being translated into French and Braille. 23. The task of raising awareness of the implications of the Equal Opportunities Act 2008 would be handled by the future Equal Opportunities Division of the NHRC. 24. The Government is currently considering whether to make the report of the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture (SPT) public. Amendments to the Protection of Human Rights Act to enhance the functioning of the NHRC are being considered and legislation will be enacted to provide for the establishment of a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM). 25. Police officers are already accountable with regard to ill-treatment of detainees. Suspected acts of misconduct of police officers may be investigated by the Complaints Investigation Bureau (in cases of minor default), the NHRC, the Ombudsman or the courts and disciplinary or criminal proceedings are initiated against the officers, where appropriate. In addition, draft legislation, which will provide for the establishment of a police complaints authority, is currently being finalized. B.

About 37 police officers are being prosecuted and there is no longer a perception of impunity for police officers. The Government had recently, without awaiting the judgment of the Court, given ex-gratia payment to the families of 2 persons who had died in police custody. Regarding the law on the police complaints authority, the delegation stated that the legislation will be passed later this year and consultations with different parties are taking place. 76. The delegation explained that the aim of the Combating of Trafficking in Persons Bill is to give effect to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, to prevent and combat trafficking in persons , to protect and assist victims and to ensure that those indulging in trafficking in persons are prosecuted. Regarding overcrowding in prisons, a series of measures were taken, including the creation of additional accommodation for 377 detainees in various prisons and of 14 Segregation and Protection Units, the extension of the women’s prison, and the construction of a new high security prison. There is a fast track at the prosecution level for those awaiting trial who cannot afford to pay for release on bail. 77. Concerning the working and living conditions and the rights of migrant workers, the delegation informed that an expatriate worker has the right to form or join a trade union of his own choosing without previous authorization and without any discrimination, and has other rights pertaining to trade union and collective bargaining activities. A Special Migrant Workers Unit was set up within the Ministry of Labour in 1999 to ensure that conditions of employment of migrant workers are in compliance with national laws. It carried out 752 inspections in 2008 at the work places and responds promptly to all complaints from expatriate workers, including anonymous complaint letters. 78. The objectives of the Family Welfare and Protection Unit are to implement appropriate policies and strategies to promote family welfare and to adopt relevant strategies and implement actions to combat domestic violence.
