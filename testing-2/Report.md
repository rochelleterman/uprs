## Change Logs / Questions

### Institutions:

Erin added some but I think we should stop included more unless they're really significant

**Changes**:

1. HCR is now "Human Rights Council". (new)
2. "Human Rights Committee" is now listed under ICCPR
3. Added "UNHCR"

**Issues**:

1. Make sure "hague" is listed in the codebook
2. I added HCR but this should only refer to specific mentions of the UPR and HRC, not vague "recommendations"?

### Action:

**Changes**:

- Updated "ratifi"

**Issues:**

1. Double check that 'implement' is on codebook

### Theme:

The worst ones here were "foreign-movement", "governance", "post-conflict," and "discrimination". 

**Changes:**

- Added section splitting women's rights in social, economic + political.  Need to add to codebook.
- Linked 'UNHRC' to 'migrants'

**Issues:**

1. 'corporal punishment' always about children? Usually, but not always explicitely.

2. 'social services' to 'poverty'? The problem is that this is SO vague and overly used, too inclusive.

3. 'welfare' :same problem as above. Too inclusive. Should we add it anyway?
