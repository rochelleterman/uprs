The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth session from 22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of the Czech Republic was held at the 1st meeting, held on 22 October 2012. The delegation of the Czech Republic was headed by Vladimír Galu.ka, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 29 October 2012, the Working Group adopted the report on the Czech Republic. 2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Czech Republic: Chile, Malaysia and Mauritania. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of the Czech Republic:  (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/14/CZE/1);  (b) A compilation prepared by Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/14/CZE/2 and Corr.2);  (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/14/CZE/3). 4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belarus, Denmark, Mexico, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to the Czech Republic through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR).  I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process  A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The Czech Republic highlighted its transparent approach to the preparation of the national report. The Office of the Government Commissioner for Human Rights had regularly invited representatives of civil society to submit their comments on the draft national report. 6. The Czech Republic particularly mentioned the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination Act in 2009. It had also ratified several human rights instruments, including the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the Additional Protocol to the European Social Charter Providing for a System of Collective Complaints. The adoption of legislation concerning the criminal liability of legal entities would allow the Czech Republic to proceed with the ratification of other United Nations and Council of Europe conventions. The Czech Republic focused its efforts on the integration of the Roma minority by elaborating comprehensive strategies on that issue. Inclusive education of Roma children was addressed by new legislation setting rules for placement of children in practical schools. The National Strategy for the Protection of the Rights of the Child was designed to fully meet the obligations arising from the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Similar strategies had been developed to improve the lives of persons with disabilities and victims of human trafficking. 7. The Czech Republic highlighted the promotion of equal treatment and respect towards Roma in all its policies. The Government Agency for Social Inclusion and the Commissioner for Human Rights were preparing a new three-year anti-racism campaign, to begin in 2013. In response to the recent social challenges, the Commissioner was establishing a working group for solving all future similar social conflicts. 8. Czech Labour Offices paid special attention to all long-term unemployed persons, including Roma, for whom they developed individual tailored action plans. At the same time, the Czech Republic highlighted that due to personal data protection, the authorities were not allowed to collect data based on ethnicity. 9. Regarding the representation of Roma in public service, the Czech Republic stated that public service was open to everyone regardless of race or ethnicity. Roma were often employed as teacher assistants, social workers and regional coordinators or local counsellors for Roma minority affairs. 10. Regarding Roma integration, the Government Council for Roma Minority Affairs was the principal platform for the Government’s cooperation with the Roma minority. Each region was obliged to appoint a coordinator for Roma minority affairs. Many municipalities had created the post of Roma counsellor. 11. Regarding inclusive education for Roma children, the Czech Republic referred to the legislative changes aimed at the education of every child according to his or her learning abilities. The temporary placement of socially disadvantaged children in practical schools as a last resort to improve their education chances would be abolished. It planned to monitor the ethnicity of children in practical schools to evaluate the progress of integration of children with special needs into mainstream education. 12. Regarding hate crime, the Czech Republic stated that various forms of hate crime were subject to different provisions of the Criminal Code and a racial motive constituted an aggravating circumstance. All crimes were duly investigated and prosecuted to bring the perpetrators to justice. 13. The Czech Republic was introducing new comprehensive strategies to protect the rights of the child: a new bill on the social and legal protection of children had been prepared, whose main aim was to reduce the high number of children in institutional care and to promote preventive work with families. 14. Regarding gender equality, the Czech Republic stated that the Anti-Discrimination Act prohibited discrimination based on sex and gender and entrusted the Ombudsman with powers to help discrimination victims, to carry out surveys and to issue recommendations on the fight against discrimination. The Government Council for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men may evaluate Government policies from the point of gender equality and propose policies in that field. Victims of discrimination may refer to special public control bodies which can impose sanctions, or to courts which can award compensation. 15. Regarding alleged participation in the illegal detention and transportation of prisoners by the CIA, the Czech Republic stated that all cases of persons transferred to another country through its territory, and all extradition cases, were processed strictly in accordance with the applicable legislation, which respects the international human rights commitments of the Czech Republic. It had also conducted a full and independent inquiry into alleged secret CIA flights through its territory, which did not find any case of persons being carried in transit through or extradited from its territory to countries where they would face torture or other cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 16. Regarding prison conditions, the Czech Republic stated that the Government had introduced new legislation that would reduce the number of prisoners. The Government also focused its efforts on improving prison conditions. 17. The Czech Republic stated that it had developed a long-term policy concept on the integration of foreigners. Foreigners could use a wide range of services provided by the State, regions and municipalities for counselling and assistance. 18. Regarding special policies for women and elderly persons, the Czech Republic stated that it had adopted several action plans against domestic violence with measures aimed at victims, witnesses and the perpetrators. The rights of the victim would be supported by a future law on crime victims. 19. Concerning elderly persons, the State had adopted the National Programme to Prepare for Population Ageing (2008–2012), aimed at creating a supportive, integrated and friendly environment for older people with full respect for their rights and dignity. The Government Council for Older Persons and Population Ageing provided a platform for Government representatives, civil society and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to meet and discuss the problems of the elderly population. 20. The Czech Republic also referred to the ratification of the Optional Protocol to CRPD. The establishment of the independent monitoring mechanism was currently being discussed in the Government.  B.

It also stressed allegations of trafficking of foreign migrant workers and fraud in the forest industry, where people were forced to work up to 12 hours per day with very little or no pay. DPRK made recommendations. 23. Denmark shared its appreciation of the activities of the Agency for Social Inclusion within the field of the integration of national minorities.

Rwanda congratulated the Czech Republic on the progress made in successfully implementing many of the recommendations of the first UPR cycle, and encouraged it to implement the remaining recommendations. Rwanda made recommendations. 54. The Czech Republic stated that equal opportunities for education of Roma children were a fundamental issue to which the Czech Republic gave primary attention. The best interest of the child and his or her quality education were the basic principles of the numerous measures already adopted in that regard. The Czech Republic had applied a whole range of measures to decrease the number of Roma children in so-called practical schools. The report of the Czech School Inspection from June 2012 showed a slight improvement in that regard. The number of Roma children in those schools had decreased by 8.6 per cent since the school year 2009/10, but the existing 26.4 per cent still underlined the need for more action in this field. The Czech Republic provided information on present and future measures it was taking to further improve the equal opportunities in education of Roma children. Such measures were designed to ensure that ethnicity and social backgrounds have no impact on the placement of pupils into education programmes. 55. The Czech Republic stressed the seriousness of human trafficking in a globalized world. Its prevention must be the first step to eradicate that crime. Therefore, the Czech authorities focused on disseminating information to target groups and relevant authorities. A major information campaign against trafficking in human beings targeting the clients of prostitution had been organized between 2007 and 2010. The Czech Republic encouraged people to report cases of forced prostitution. Websites in several languages and telephone hotlines had been launched. Promotion materials were distributed among target groups. Materials on human trafficking and child trafficking had also been distributed among public authorities and the general public. The criminal offence of human trafficking had been extended in the new Criminal Code to implement the Council of Europe conventions and European Union law. Profiting from human trafficking was also criminalized. Children were accorded special protection against human trafficking and sexual exploitation. In both cases, consent of the victim was irrelevant for prosecution. The criminal act of human trafficking was considered an especially serious crime. Accordingly, many special investigative measures were available. Failure to report human trafficking was also a crime. Persons helping victims of trafficking were exempted from that obligation. However, they were encouraged to report such crime, in the interest of the victim. 56. The Czech Republic confirmed that it was firmly committed to fighting organized crime in all its forms. Following the new act on criminal liability of legal persons for crimes committed, legal entities could be held criminally liable and the Czech law was currently in full compliance with OP-CRC-SC; the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime and its supplementary protocols, namely, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (Palermo Protocol) and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air; and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. The ratification process was gradually starting and the depositions of the ratification instruments were expected during upcoming years. 57. The Czech Republic acknowledged the importance of equality and anti-discrimination. The most important legal regulation was the Anti-Discrimination Act, adopted in 2009, which prohibited discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability and religion in the areas of employment, social security and social benefits, health care, education and access to goods and services. Victims could claim damages in courts and could be represented by specialized NGOs. Equal treatment was also controlled by public authorities who could impose monetary fines on perpetrators of discriminatory acts. Those authorities kept records on cases of discrimination and formulated their plans of work accordingly to focus on the most important areas. The national authority leading the fight against discrimination was the Ombudsman, whose tasks were to help enforce the right to equal treatment, assist discrimination victims, conduct research, publish reports and recommendations on discrimination issues and disseminate information. 58. Slovakia recognized the dedication of the Czech Republic to improving its human rights record and welcomed the adoption of the National Plan of Action for Inclusive Education, the Anti-Discrimination Act, the new Criminal Code and amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure, as well as the creation of the Agency for Social Inclusion. Slovakia made recommendations.  59.

It also praised strategies and policies developed to combat human trafficking and encouraged the Government to intensify those efforts. Sri Lanka made recommendations. 63. Thailand commended efforts to eliminate discrimination against minorities through new legislation and legislative changes. It highlighted the Government’s statement of regret for the identified cases of women whose sterilizations were inconsistent with law and welcomed the measures adopted to prevent their recurrence, provide for compensation and ensure that consent forms are in the Roma language. Thailand made recommendations. 64. Tunisia, noting the progress made in human rights since 2008, including the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination Act, encouraged the Czech Republic to continue its efforts to combat hate crimes and to incite high-level State officials to take a clear stance against hate crimes. It stated that there was no national human rights institution in full compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). Tunisia made recommendations. 65. Turkey acknowledged the steps taken to promote and protect children’s rights, notably its signing of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Turkey made recommendations. 66. The United Kingdom welcomed measures to tackle discrimination against minorities and ensure greater Roma representation in Government bodies. It encouraged the Czech Republic to enhance progress by, inter alia, addressing the segregation of Roma children into “special” schools and improving the monitoring of measures to eliminate discrimination on grounds of race, sex or age. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 67. The United States of America remained concerned about the treatment of Roma and other minorities, particularly the unlawful segregation of Roma children into special schools; that socially disadvantaged minorities faced discrimination in housing and employment; and that racism or intolerance sometimes resulted in violence. Furthermore, official corruption hampered economic growth and undermined human rights implementation and faith in public institutions. The United States made recommendations. 68. Uruguay said that the Czech Republic still had some institutional problems and issues with regard to the process of bringing its domestic legislation into line with international standards, as well as the limitations and restrictions imposed on the Roma population, that must be addressed. It pointed out that the current Ombudsman had limited competences, and highlighted the importance of an independent mechanism. Uruguay made recommendations. 69. Uzbekistan noted the persistent violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Czech Republic. It regretted that the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child that compulsory education should be ensured for children with disabilities had not been implemented due to a lack of resources. It was concerned about racial discrimination and intolerance, and statements of a racist and xenophobic nature. Uzbekistan made recommendations. 70. Algeria noted steps taken to combat racism and racial discrimination and the criminalization of racially or ethnically motivated violence. Algeria echoed concerns about the decision by the Czech Republic not to develop a national action plan against racism and regretted the rejection of the recommendation to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and encouraged a review of that position. Algeria made recommendations. 71. Argentina congratulated the Czech Republic on the creation of the National Plan of Action for Inclusive Education and on the ratification of CRPD. Argentina made recommendations. 72. Armenia supported all measures adopted to enforce individual rights and freedoms, particularly relating to integrating foreigners and protecting human rights defenders at home and abroad. It welcomed the new Criminal Code, the Strategy for Combating Extremism to tackle racism and neo-Nazism, the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination Act and the Crime Prevention Strategy. Armenia made recommendations. 73. Australia applauded the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination Act and the National Plan of Action for Inclusive Education. However, it remained concerned by reports that Roma children continued to experience systematic discrimination in accessing education. It encouraged the Czech Republic to continue implementing measures to remove discrimination against ethnic minorities, including the Roma community. Australia made recommendations. 74. Austria wondered whether the racially motivated violent public demonstrations of 2011 in Northern Bohemia had been fully investigated and the perpetrators held accountable. It shared concerns about the segregation of Roma children in education. It asked whether the Czech Republic would establish a mechanism to evaluate its national strategy on human trafficking and ratify the Palermo Protocol and the Council of Europe Convention Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. Austria made recommendations. 75. Bangladesh welcomed legislative changes to protect children’s rights, and institutional initiatives on social inclusion. It urged the Czech Republic to ensure that hate crime, violence, racism and xenophobia were investigated and the perpetrators prosecuted. It was concerned about the exploitation of migrant workers, the ill-treatment of foreigners in prisons and the segregation of Roma children. Bangladesh made recommendations. 76. Belarus highlighted the concerns of treaty bodies about the use of torture and ill-treatment in prisons, medical and psychiatric facilities, discrimination against Roma, human trafficking, domestic and sexual violence, degrading conditions in detention centres for asylum seekers, and the atmosphere of impunity, particularly within the police and prison service. Belarus made recommendations. 77. Belgium highlighted measures adopted to improve minority rights, including establishing a network of regional coordinators for Roma affairs, the Agency for Social Inclusion and the drafting of a handbook on homophobia. It welcomed the adoption of the new Crime Prevention Strategy, including a component on combating discriminatory and xenophobic stereotypes through campaigns aimed especially at youth. Belgium made recommendations. 78. Brazil praised the institutionalization of the Agency for Social Inclusion of Roma communities and the establishment of criteria for the informed consent of women prior to sterilization. It recognized efforts against trafficking in persons. It was concerned at the challenges still faced by the Roma people and at the arbitrary approach of migration authorities towards foreigners, including racial profiling. Brazil made recommendations. 79. Bulgaria commended the implementation of all accepted recommendations of the first UPR and the ratification of many international human rights instruments. It asked what specific measures had been identified for the next two years to fully implement the National Strategy for the Protection of the Rights of the Child by 2015. 80. Cambodia praised efforts to address political, economic and social challenges, particularly in combating social exclusion and human trafficking and protecting children’s rights. It welcomed the ratification of a number of important international human rights and humanitarian instruments, the enactment of legislation on punishment for crimes and human trafficking, and the adoption of the Strategy on Policing Minorities. Cambodia made a recommendation. 81. Canada requested information on progress made in implementing the recommendations to enact comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation and to develop effective measures to eliminate multiple forms of discrimination. It welcomed the many legislative changes to strengthen the protection of human rights and freedoms, but was concerned that measures to address the segregation of Roma children in education were not being consistently applied. Canada made recommendations. 82. Chad noted with satisfaction that the Czech Republic had accepted 29 of the 30 recommendations during the first UPR cycle and that it was a party to most international human rights instruments. However, it asked how legislation specifically ensured that patients enjoyed rights and status equal to those of health workers. 83. China was deeply concerned over continued acts of racism, xenophobia and the deteriorating human rights situation of minority groups, such as Roma. Violence against the Roma community had continued unabated and Roma had suffered discrimination in many areas, including education, employment and housing. Anti-Roma contents had even been found in primary school teaching materials. China made recommendations. 84. Costa Rica welcomed the significant steps made in human rights, especially in combating violence against children, including providing specialized training for the judiciary. While it welcomed the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman, it pointed out that the Office was not in accordance with the Paris Principles, and urged the Czech Republic to rectify the situation. Costa Rica made recommendations. 85. Cuba shared concerns about discrimination against minority groups, particularly Roma, and persistent displays of racism and xenophobia and associated violence. It lamented the failure to prohibit organizations that incited racial discrimination. It was also concerned at reports of prison overcrowding, which had led to an increase in violence among prisoners and suicides. Cuba made recommendations. 86. Cyprus welcomed efforts to integrate foreigners, combat racism, protect children’s rights and address the situation of socially excluded Roma. It asked about the intention of the Czech Republic to improve women’s opportunities in the labour market and their participation in policy- and decision-making, and whether the victims of violence and rape had access to legal aid and exercised their right to compensation. 87. The Czech Republic underlined that it considered the integration of the Roma minority as one of its principal goals. The Roma Integration Concept for 2010–2013 and the Strategy to Combat Social Exclusion 2012–2015 were the main documents and included comprehensive integrative measures in relevant areas. The implementation of those measures was assessed annually in a report prepared by the Government Commissioner for Human Rights. The main platform for Roma participation was the Government Council for Roma Minority Affairs, which is composed of Government ministers and deputy ministers and Roma representatives on a parity level. In addition, the Agency for Social Inclusion was a Government expert body helping with social inclusion on the local level. Each of the 14 regional governments employed a regional Roma coordinator and there were also 164 Roma counsellors in municipalities. 88. The Czech Republic fully recognized the right of individuals to control and decide on matters of their own sexuality and reproductive health. The Ombudsman reported in 2006, however, that there had been individual cases in which the procedure prescribed by law had not been followed properly. In 2009, the Government officially expressed its regret for past sterilizations performed contrary to the legal regulation, and it committed to adopt measures to prevent their reoccurrence. New legislation, in effect since 2012, reinforced the guarantees of patients’ rights with respect to free and informed consent. The Government was presently considering a proposal to establish a non-judicial mechanism that could complement the existing judicial means by providing a possibility to award compensation ex gratia. A new complex set of rules which should facilitate access to legal aid was also being considered. 89. The Czech Republic condemned xenophobia and racist violence. In 2008–2009 there was a resurgence of right-wing extremists, who focused their hatred mostly on Roma. The Government responded firmly to this phenomenon. The criminal law enabled the prosecution of racist and hate attacks and speech. Problems could be encountered in practice in relation to proving hate motivation of the offender. In response, police and prosecutors had received specialized training and had access to a database of relevant information. The most visible hate crime was an arson attack committed against a Roma family. The investigation was successful and all offenders received heavy penalties. The Government also successfully proposed banning the extremist Workers’ Party. The Supreme Administrative Court established in that case clear criteria for dissolving parties for extremist propaganda while respecting freedom of association. The success in those highly visible cases had a serious impact on the extremist scene. Its principal drivers had been paralysed or significantly weakened. Subsequently, the focus shifted to preventive tools, such as training of law enforcement officials, preventive programmes and maintaining public order in socially excluded neighbourhoods. 90. The Czech Republic reported on the governmental campaign against racism, which had provided, since 2006, grants to NGOs on projects aimed at tackling prejudices and stereotypes, raising awareness against intolerance and extremist activities, and presenting examples of best practices and positive Roma role models. Moreover in 2009 and 2010, the “Gypsy Spirit” prize had been awarded to present the efforts and achievements of persons contributing to the development of Roma or the Roma culture and identity. Recently, in response to the social challenges, the Commissioner for Human Rights had initiated an action plan to synchronize future steps of all relevant stakeholders to deal with similar confrontations. Furthermore, an anti-racist campaign entitled “Hate-Free Culture” was being prepared, which was adapted to the communication of young people and aimed at creating a community that would be active in intercultural dialogue and the fight against hate violence. 91. The Czech Republic also referred to the newly adopted National Strategy for the Protection of the Rights of the Child, which focused on the best interest of the child as a crucial principle of all State activities. The Strategy strengthened coordination and cooperation among public administration bodies involved in the protection of children at risk under the lead of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs; defined basic principles of protection of children’s rights; included goals and activities, with a timetable, monitoring and evaluation; and ensured that activities of all relevant subjects comply with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Strategy also focused on promoting the quality of life of children and families, eliminating discrimination against children and providing support for the development of children in their family or in substitute family care. The latter would be strictly prioritized over institutional care. 92. The Czech Republic stated that the principle of equal opportunities for women and men had become an integral part of both internal and foreign policy. The prohibition of discrimination on the ground of sex was included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms and in the Anti-Discrimination Act. The equal position of both genders would be achieved only through consistent application of the anti-discrimination legislation. Furthermore, the Government recognized the negative role of gender stereotypes and the underrepresentation of women in decision-making processes. Therefore, the education of the whole society as regards the issue of gender equality and tolerance was another important feature of the Government policy, along with the systematic implementation of gender mainstreaming within the whole State governance. 93.
