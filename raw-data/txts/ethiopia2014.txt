These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The delegation of Ethiopia said that Ethiopia had taken a transparent and participatory approach in the preparation of the national report. The process had been led by the National Interministerial Committee and had involved the participation of various stakeholders and the dissemination of information on the implementation of the recommendations accepted at the first review. 6. Ethiopia had established a solid constitutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights, which embedded ratified international human rights instruments. It guaranteed the human rights of all Ethiopians and ensured implementation of the rights of  the nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia to self-determination, to the preservation of their language, culture and history, and to representation and self-administration in the federal and regional states.  7. Ethiopia had made major strides in the promotion and protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. It had registered double digit growth over the previous 10 years and had integrated the goal of achieving good governance, the rule of law and human rights in the ongoing five-year Growth and Transformation Plan. 8. Ethiopia had adopted the first National Human Rights Action Plan (NHRAP). A Ministerial Steering Committee had been established for the formulation and implementation of the Plan, with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission monitoring and evaluating its implementation. Mechanisms had been put in place for the participation of civil society. 9. The Proclamation on Charities and Societies ensured the realization of the right to freedom of association and provided an environment conducive to the growth and development of charities and societies. The Proclamation ensured accountability through predictability and transparency. It had created favourable conditions for the establishment and growth of grass-roots advocacy, and humanitarian and developmental civil society groups that could  thrive and serve their members and society at large. 10. The Proclamation required civil society organizations to allot 70 per cent of their budget for programme activities and the remaining portion for overhead costs. Agreements had also been signed with foreign civil society groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 11. Ethiopia had zero tolerance for torture and inhuman, degrading or other cruel treatment,, which were prohibited by the Constitution. Measures, including the Prison Administration Proclamation, were in place to protect the rights of persons deprived of their liberty.  12. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission monitored prison conditions and had provided capacity-building training to police and prison officers. Legal and policy measures had been taken on the rights of persons to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Religious groups had established an interreligious council to maintain and advance interreligious tolerance. 13. Ethiopia recognized the imperatives of respecting human rights while countering terrorism. Proclamations, consistent with international human rights obligations, had been promulgated on anti-terrorism and anti-money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Anti-Terrorism Proclamation would not be used to silence opposition. 14. Freedom of expression continued to thrive. Ethiopians freely advocated their views either in support of or in criticism of government policies and measures. The Freedom of Mass Media and Access to Information Proclamation had been implemented in accordance with relevant constitutional guarantees. A national task force, spearheaded by the institution of the Ombudsman, had been established to oversee the effective implementation of access to information provisions of the Proclamation. 15. The delegation reported on the various measures taken to improve the welfare of children and the measures taken to promote and protect the rights of women and ensure their equal participation in political affairs, economic and social empowerment, ownership of property, inheritance of and rights over resources, as well as to combat harmful traditional practices, including female genital mutilation (FGM), and child, early and forced marriage. 16. Ethiopia was committed to implementing effectively the laws and policy frameworks for promoting the human rights of persons with disabilities by integrating disability as a cross-cutting sector of development. 17. Ethiopia had also initiated the process of ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW) and had been working with host countries to advance the rights and interests of Ethiopian nationals abroad. It had intensified its efforts for the protection of the rights of migrants, with a special emphasis on migrant women and children. A national task force, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, had been established for that purpose.  18. Ethiopia maintained an open door policy towards refugees and was hosting over half a million of them. It worked closely with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other United Nations agencies to provide protection and assistance to the refugees and mitigate the effects of hosting a large refugee population on the local host communities and the environment. 19. Ethiopia was determined to ensure that the fifth national election, to be held in May 2015, would be free, fair and credible. The National Electoral Board and the judiciary had developed innovative systems for handling grievances and complaints during elections. 20. Ethiopia pursued a rights-based approach to development, with the objective of reducing poverty. Per capita income had increased and the proportion of the population living below the poverty line and the food poverty index had declined significantly. 21. Rapid economic growth had also enabled Ethiopia to undertake massive public investments in the social and infrastructure sectors. Investments in the construction of new health facilities and the upgrading of existing ones, and in strengthening the implementation of the health extension programme had brought about significant improvements in the health and well-being of the people. During 2012/2013, primary health service coverage had reached 93 per cent, while significant progress had been made in improving maternal and child health. Ethiopia had already achieved the Millennium Development Goal target of reducing child mortality by two thirds well before the 2015 deadline. 22. Massive investments had been made in the expansion of primary, secondary and tertiary education. Primary education was free for all citizens. The primary gross enrolment rate had increased to 95.4 per cent, and over 17.3 million children had been enrolled in primary schools in 2012/13. That progress had brought Ethiopia closer to achieving the Millennium Development Goal target of universal access to primary education. The gender parity index in primary schools as approximated by the ratio of girls to boys had reached 0.94:1 in 2012/13. 23. Ethiopia had invested massively in road maintenance and construction, in potable water supply and in energy and irrigation schemes, which demonstrated the positive impact of the economic growth on improving the non-income dimension of its citizensÕ welfare. In line with its focus on eradicating poverty, the Government had allocated a higher share of its budget to pro-poor sectors. 24. Since the first UPR cycle, Ethiopia had ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and PeoplesÕ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC). Ethiopia had also submitted implementation reports under the International Convention on All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), the Convention on All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), CRPD, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the African Charter on Human and PeoplesÕ Rights and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. B.
