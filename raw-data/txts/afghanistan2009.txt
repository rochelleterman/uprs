At the 8th meeting, on 7 May 2009, the Deputy Minister of Justice opened his statement by referring to Afghanistan’s State report, prepared in a participatory process based on principles of transparency, participation, responsibility, accountability, nondiscrimination and inclusiveness. His delegation included representatives from law enforcement institutions, national human rights watch agencies and civil society.   6. Following almost three decades of war and disorder, Afghanistan’s legal, political, social and cultural infrastructure is weakened. Nevertheless, in direct cooperation with the international community, Afghanistan managed to make a number of important achievements, including the adoption of the 2004 Constitution which laid the foundation of Afghanistan’s legal framework. It bound the Government to monitor and observe the Charter of the United Nations, the International Declaration of Human Rights, international treaties and human rights conventions ratified by Afghanistan.  7. The delegation provided additional information on measures taken to enhance the professional capacity of national human rights institutions, the efforts made to entrench human rights and challenges encountered.  8. The Supreme Court has trained some 800 judges on fair trial and more then 750 modern and Sharia law graduates have been employed in the justice sector. Lack of security remains the main challenge for courts and judges. The Ministry of Justice has established the Bar Association and registered 102 political parties and 1,348 social organizations. However, despite these efforts some problems remain, including the failure to meet human rights standards inside the prisons. The Attorney-General’s Office faces problems due to lack of availability of lawyers especially in the provinces, lack of security for prosecutors, shortage of technical equipment during investigation, interference of powerful people and low salary levels for prosecutors. The Ministry of the Interior has made efforts in training the Afghan National Police to protect human rights in discharging its duties. Nevertheless, a number of complaints show that further work is needed in this area.  9. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) with support from the Government has been able to monitor prisons and detention centres without prior notice. In agreement with a number of international military forces it has also able to monitor the situation of Afghans detained accused of having links with terrorists. A number of additional, specialized commissions have been established recently to ensure security of human rights, including  the anti-corruption and civil administration reform commission, commission to address capital punishment cases, board for addressing complaints of prisoners transferred from Bagram airbase and Guantanamo prison, board for addressing the situation of prisoners in Kabul’s main prisons and detention centres, and commission for elimination of violence against women. 10. Civil society plays an important role in conducting research on different human rights issues.  11. The delegation mentioned some of the most important national policies and strategies adopted to systematically support human rights, including the Afghan National Development Strategy approved by the President on 21 April 2008.   12. The Transitional Justice Strategy and Action Plan on Peace, Justice and Reconciliation was adopted in 2005.  With regard to implementation of transitional justice, judicial actions were not taken due to lack of suitable conditions, for example, insecurity, lack of required capacity in the Government and the influence of powerful violators of human rights.  13. The delegation provided further information regarding measures for social protection. The Government was providing shelter to 9,312 orphan children in 54 orphanages, a total of 362 kindergartens were fully functional throughout the country. Concerning the right to food and to an adequate standard of living and shelter, in 2005, 44 per cent of Afghans lived under the poverty line, and 75 per cent did not have food security. The Ministry of Agriculture has developed a special food security programme in May 2008. Additionally, the rapid growth of urban dwellings, the return of new groups of refugees and internally displaced people, the expansion of poverty and slums in the cities put the Government in a difficult situation when considering citizen’s right to shelter.  14. Achievements in the last seven years on the right to health included a reduction in mortality rate of children under five. Health service coverage increased to 85 per cent of the population through 1,688 functioning medical facilities. Yet, malnutrition remained one of the most challenging public health issues.  15. On the right to education, the delegation provided information on some positive developments. In 2008 more than 6 million students attended schools, one third of whom were girls with 15,842 attending schools in rural areas. Adult literacy courses for women had opened all over the country. However, major challenges remained, including the destruction of schools by armed anti-Government forces, the shortage of qualified teachers particularly in rural areas, the shortage of financial and technical resources and low salaries for teachers.  16. The delegation pointed out that ensuring the right to life of citizens has been one of the biggest challenges. It is often violated through civilian casualties and suicide bombings.  17. Concerning media and freedom of expression, the delegation explained that there were three national and 21 local television stations in the country, only one was State-run. Some 57 radio stations operated throughout the country and hundreds of newspapers and pamphlets published in an environment free of fear and censorship. He noted some of the main challenges, such as the lack of professionalism in some journalistic circles and the intimidation of journalists by armed anti-Government forces.  18. Regarding efforts in the area of non-discrimination and equality, over the last seven years Afghanistan made some major achievements in ensuring women’s rights, including the formation of the Ministry of Women Affairs. Twenty-eight per cent of the National Assembly members were women, the highest proportion in the region. However, due to insecurity in some provinces, a culture of immunity from punishment, low awareness of women’s rights, particularly among women themselves, old and harmful superstitious customs and lack of job opportunities were among the most pressing challenges.  19. Reference was made to measures taken concerning the rights of minorities, human trafficking and the rights of the child. Afghanistan has about 1,000,000 disabled persons. The Government cannot extend sufficient assistance to them due to lack of resources and facilities. However, the Law on the rights and benefits of disabled people and the Law on victims of war and their families have been adopted.  20. Currently a total of 3.3 million Afghans live in neighboring countries. The Government has made efforts to alleviate the situation but success depends on the level of cooperation by the host countries.  21. The delegation considered that the UPR State reporting process provided a unique opportunity to highlight the achievements and the challenges of human rights in Afghanistan and a good opportunity for the international community and other human rights actors in the world to put the situation of Afghanistan in a realistic comparative analytical perspective and consider its problems and challenges.  B.  Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 22. During the interactive dialogue 59 delegations made statements. A number of delegations appreciated the balanced report prepared by Afghanistan, indicating, inter alia, progress made and remaining constraints and challenges.   23. Algeria expressed concern about the situation of civilians affected by armed conflict, especially yesterday’s victims in Afghanistan and requested clarification of the President’s refusal to sign the “National Reconciliation Charter”. Algeria made a number of recommendations concerning: the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, achieving the national development strategy, and seeking assistance for report preparation and achieving the MDGs. 24. Qatar noted that human rights in Afghanistan are guaranteed by a number of political and judicial mechanisms and that the Constitution ensures the rights and freedoms of citizens.

India noted that much more needed to be done, especially in capacity building, improving civilian oversight of security forces, enhancing justice administration and combating adverse social practices against women and children. Pointing out its USD 1.2 billion assistance since 2002, crucial in the fulfilment of basic human rights in Afghanistan, India noted its serious concern at increasing terrorist activities by Taliban that targeted development efforts by the international community, like the attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul in July 2008. 26.

Bhutan recognized the challenges and constraints faced by Afghanistan and noted that progress in the area of governance and towards the achievement of the MDG targets in health and education were encouraging.

The existing law, which complies with all international commitments, and has been enforced for the last four years, removed all restrictions on freedom of expression. The new press law also remained consistent international commitments. Its implementation has been delayed due to some technicalities. 84.

However, the penalty is rarely applied; it can only be applied after the decision of the trial court and two stages of appellate courts, including the Supreme Court. The application of the sentence further requires the consent of the President, who scrutinizes the whole case with the intention of finding reason to commute the sentence.  85.

While laws drafted under the present Government were consistent with human rights standards, resources and personnel were needed to review earlier laws to ensure their conformity with international commitments.   88. The delegation noted that Afghanistan acceded to the United Nations Convention against Corruption in 2003 and that the fight against corruption is mainstreamed in the work of Government.  A special unit and prosecutor’s office has been established to fight corruption.  The Government is committed to the protection and promotion of women’s rights and has established a National Action Plan for Women to promote gender equality and enforce gender mainstreaming in governmental institutions. The Ministry of Women provides capacity-building classes, microcredit opportunities and literacy classes. Afghan women participate in 34 provincial councils and are active members of various political parties. Additionally, AIHRC is currently headed by a woman. Initial steps have been taken to prepare an initial report for the Committee on Discrimination against Women.   89. The delegation of Afghanistan responded to the observations of the Philippines and New Zealand, noting that article 52 of the Constitution stresses the right to health. The Government has the obligation to provide free health care and the Ministry of Health is authorized to ensure medical and preventive measures for public safety. Several strategies and public-private partnerships further this aim. Between 2004 and 2008, approximately 148 policy guidelines, laws, regulations and protocols were developed, applying to different aspects of health. Afghanistan’s achievements in the years following the Taliban’s rule have resulted in reduced mortality rates of children under 5 years of age (from 257 in 2001 to 191 in 2007), the expansion of public service coverage (from 9 per cent in 2001 to 85 per cent in 2007) and expansion of immunization to cover 83 per cent of the population.  The Government stressed that the top health priority now is to improve maternal health and reduce maternal mortality. 90. In response to the observation made by Morocco, Afghanistan referred to the water law and the establishment of a programme to provide safe drinking water for 15 million people for 5 years. Concerning people with HIV/AIDS, the delegation indicated that there are 556 cases in the country and the Government has established counselling programs, testing and treatment centres, drop-in programmes, outreach programmes and a strong effort to raise awareness among community and health workers. 91. Various reform processes are under way to improve of performance of the police.  Due to 30 years of war and the existence of layers of laws and practices inherited from various regimes, some laws might not conform to international human rights standards. The delegation emphasized that all police officers are expected to respect human rights and follow the rule of law and that the in-service training provided to them at all training centres and schools emphasize these expectations. When a complaint is filed alleging violation of human rights by police officers, the case is referred to the Inspector-General who investigates the charges. If evidence of misconduct is found, penalties are imposed.   92. The Inspector-General reports directly to the Minister of the Interior and has a human rights unit in headquarters and human rights offices in the provinces to ensure proper police conduct across the country.  93. Since March 2008 private security companies are subject to administrative regulations. There are currently 39 legally registered companies regulated under this law. The remaining private security companies are considered illegal armed groups and are being disarmed. A draft law seeking to strengthen regulation of private security forces is being debated in Parliament. 94. The delegation emphasized that the Afghan Constitution prohibits torture under any circumstances. If a court were to discover that an admission were obtained under torture, that admission would be considered invalid and those who commit an act of torture would face prosecution. The Government further mentioned that it has received the support of international donors to set up legal aid programmes and offices in different provinces in Afghanistan. The delegation concluded its intervention by thanking the Council for the opportunity to discuss human rights developments and challenges facing Afghanistan and stressed the Government’s determination to improve the human rights situation with the assistance of the international community. II.
